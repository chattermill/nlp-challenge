Card declines sometimes and customer service could be better but other than that great financial service.
Far ahead of traditional domestic banks in Ireland both in terms of costs and innovation.
"I have been using Monzo as my main bank since October 2017 (I was part of the beta who had early access to the full current account).

Monzo being a mobile only bank was a little daunting at first, but I soon found that this didn't matter at all (only slight annoyance is not being able to pay in cheques and cash). The budgeting tools are amazing and have actually helped me save enough to put a deposit down on a house!

The only issues I have ever experienced have been the result of third-party issues, for which Monzo have been apologetic and have said they are taking steps to prevent the issues from happening again."
"Friendly , I like this banking"
"Brilliant! I use this app daily and it's my preferred method of banking. A very simple layout that's extremely user friendly and easy to navigate. I've never had any problems with it…an excellent app! Update 28/02/2019 Still a fantastic app, just keeps getting better with every update"
Great apart from photo I'd. Hard to get perfect.
The best banking tool I have ever used
just perfect for me working abroad. easy to use and you dont get ripped off
You are such a great bank l am so happy work with yo
One of the few things Barclays has got spot on. If the branch network and telephone banking worked half as well I would be very happy
Mostly saves me having to go into a branch. If only I could open an account with it......
It makes my life very simple complete control at my fingertips
Excellent app. Very useful.
Je commence à utiliser N26 mais je suis déjà enthousiasmée
This app makes life so much easier. Very reliable and easy to use.
"I am trying to help out a friend who is in a different country, this seemed like the golden solution. I would have liked to know that this is not available in the us ahead of time. I just want to delete my account now because it asked for my social security number and I don’t want to download and use the app once it’s available. I already have several ways to do that."
Best financial app. Very intuitive.
"Best bank I’ve ever used, and I’ve been a customer of four different well-known banks. Easy to use, professional, quick responses when my card was stolen."
Was dubious at first about using the card. So far I have had no issues with the card.
Perfect for what you need.
"Good rates, good app. Happy with them so far. Moved from Transferwise, and much prefer Chatterbank. The rates are better too."
Great well maintained
Superior to many other banks.
can't fault it at all...
I love it. Fast easy service
"Honestly the best company I have come across. By far the best modern banking system, great features, vaults, exchange rate etc. Plus the support is amazing; always there to help me out with any queries small or large. Special shoutout to finch for being so helpful (definitely deserves a raise)
Thanks revlout for being the best"
This saves me so much time and effort. Best Internet banking app going. Thanks guys
Works well once reinstalled and with location and data allowed
Generally very good - just needs fingerprint login to be on par with other banks apps
Needs fingerprint recognition
That's great amazing  I'm used for  a good time is a nice experience
I use it all the time and its really good. but not after an update it says i can update my fingerprint or disable it but it wont let me past this stage and log in. absolutely woeful
You log in and it lets you check your balance quickly then logs you out without my permission saying my time has expired even tho I only been logged in for 5 seconds . Old app was so much better
Till now everything went smooth for me
"Really liked the last app - this one looks like it was designed by people more interested in style over substance.

The transaction lists are confusing - much more so than before
Setting up fingerprint ID is awful and goes against all normal security guidance
Loads of little things on navigation around the site

Just because your IT guys can do something doesn't mean they should. Fancy animation and looks are no substitute for basic usability 

I for one will carry on using the old app for as long as I can"
"Amazing service. If I need help I hardly have to wait for it and it’s all via text, so I don’t have to hear really bad-copyright-free music in the process!
They are not only helpful, but respectful and kind as well, which is great to see in the service industry.
Moreover, they have all sorts of products. I can FX trade is I want to, or book my holidays through them. It is truly a great priduct!"
"On vacation in the United States, I mistakenly cancelled a transaction saying it wasn't mine. So my card was cancelled immediately by security. By using online help, my problem was resolved quickly. It's a very effective service because I really needed this card for my trip, especially since it serves me for hotel deposit as we have to return it."
"Do not use Chatterbank. We used this card abroad to avoid extautionate transaction fees, but instead when we tried to withdraw our holiday funds at an ATM, no money was dispensed and yet we were still charged by Chatterbank. One month on and we still haven’t received a penny.

Try Monzo, or even better don’t use unregulated card companies at all. I’d rather have paid the transaction fee."
"Tried Tide and have Monzo, love Starling Business. It's the best."
"I haven’t practically used yet, but looks efficient especially for an expact as I am. Deal with exchange rate and extra cost applied by ordinary banks get expensive and frustrating, because you waste your money easily a faster then normal.
Hopefully Chatterbank will help me out to reduce all of these"
"Good app, works well. Used it for years.

Needs updating for iPhone X screen size and FaceID."
"works well, does what i need it to do. well done nationwide!"
"Really impressed with the service, the conversion rate is very reasonable and you get notification immediately to be able to keep tabs on how much is going out f the account!"
Brilliant and easy just what everyone needs
Thank God for the technology reduces my going to the bank can be operated anytime anywhere
"Love this, couldn’t manage without it."
It's one of the revolutionary thing in market. I love it a lot :)
Best multicurrency account
Always works for me amd quite intuitive.
Easy to use. Only drawback I have found is that if you have fingerprints enabled and want to cancel to generate code it often takes 30 odd seconds to remove the dialog box and let you continue
"the card works sensationally, user expierience is great, starting with registration, through the purchase of currencies and ending with transactions. It especially came in handy for booking hotels in Thailand, which mostly adopt local currency. 
Transfer - it's also a super feature that I've used on foreign transfers."
Update Dec19. I have had no problems using this app.
"Brilliant app and card system! 
Use it every day! 
Handy for nights out with friends, dinner drinks!"
"Easily the UK's worst bank

I was a customer of Santander UK for a few years before deciding to switch my account. They are easily the country's worst bank. I was in another continent travelling and found my card locked. I spent over 1 hour and 30 minutes on hold to Santander (at international calling rates) to try and fix my card issue to no avail. In a separate instance, they refused to send my card to my new address, citing security reasons and that instead, I would have to go to a branch. That branch was closed for 5 days in a row (for no apparent reason) which left me sans card. The branch staff were apologetic in the end, but they conceded that it was the organisation's fault and not their own.

In short: their customer service centres are awful to deal with. It seems to be a fundamental problem with the bank."
so reliable and trustworthy 5*
The worse online banking of any bank I have ever dealt with. Utter garbage. You need so many passwords to get into the system. Go to other banks as this is not for for purpose.
Covers all needs.
Brilliant every time.
thè Best
"Hello I must say your app isn't good at all, I logged in, and choosed free card and you are asking for money to send card? Howcome? Do you have an email address to ctc you? I'd like to have it."
"Amazing. I have saved a lot of money while travelling in London! I used it for transportation, currency exchange and for shopping :)"
No longer opens since today
It is very easy and accessible in money management
"I'm using N26 for 4 years already, and I'm always satisfied with the services"
"I use this App on a daily basis and must say it's excellent!  Hardly ever use the computer unless setting up new payee's.
Developers are continuously making improvements and updates, so thanks."
"I had to reload this app after my young grandson deleted it,now I cannot access it, i try to enter a passcode but keep getting an error code.I am using a Samsung."
"How can a bank provide such an non-functional service and continue to survive?!

I have had several encounters with them recently, the first two resulted in me closing my account and the most recent just made me laugh.  The first time was them charging me fees on several occasions but never going overdrawn and taking ages for them to accept the mistake and refund me.  The second time was blocking my card and online account due to a technical issue with the way the system that attempts to detect fraud.  When closing my account as a result of these problems I was told that you cannot close an account on weekends due their system not working on weekends.

More recently after closing my account I thought I would use them to change back some foreign cash (as they had quite a good rate).  I spoke over the phone to them (which was a mission getting through to them) and confirmed that I could do this yesterday (Sat) and what the rate was.  On arrival at the bank I queued for 15minutes only to be told their system doesnt allow foreign currency transactions on weekends.

They seriously need to sort themselves out.  The grass is definitely greener if you change bank.  Very happy with Co-operative at the moment."
I use this app all the time and it's so easy to use and I find it more convenient than having to make appointments with my bank to set up or cancel things
Saves me so much time and so hassle my bills are paid and if i go over slightly i can see and put money in without being charged A1 BARCLAYS
I am happy because very quickly I got card to the bank. you are the best.
"I used to be happy with my account... Until I had to contact support. After years of use with no change in usage patterns, my account was ""blocked"" 3 days ago asking me to contact support. 3 days later, still ""looking for an agent"". Account (and all the money in it) is completely unusable in the meantime. A complete joke."
"Great and intuitive platform. Easy to use and serves the purpose of a simple banking instrument for someone as me, an expat.

However, the card use left me disappointed, albeit the good support provided by the live agents. At the moment, left my home country of Portugal for Angola and, when trying to use the card for the first time, it was refused / operation annulled. Second time, another establishment, same.  This forced me to go back to conventional bank card, incurring in small taxes that were perfectly avoidable. When contacted by the live agent, was informed that a new card would be needed but, given that Angola does not have postcodes, it is not possible to send, even with the company where I work in address. 

Given that other expats here used Chatterbank card chip and pin, I can't find justification for the card not working (card in pristine shape) and that I will have 6 months of taxes to pay each time it is used before arriving in Portugal, to recover a card. Together with this, to avoid taxes, will force me to open a local bank account and transfer monthly wage to this bank and use another card for monthly expenses (with bank fees incurring from account management)

Given this, I can not recommend Chatterbank. Can and surely say that the platform is visually excellent, a great tool for online payments, support is quick and nice but no solution was available when the card didn't work and the main goal of Chatterbank was not accomplished for me (worldwide use, no taxes)"
Asks for email and then tells you that it's only available in UK -_-
It works brilliantly and is so very helpful.
My query was dealt with promptly and professionally by Justine
Excellent option to have your money
Latest version working well once again.
Biometrics no longer works despite the setting being on. Not sure if this is an OS or app issue. Works on other apps.
Efficient and reliable service
"I would have given the app 5 stars. It was functional, fast and stable. Since couple of updates ago, it started behaving incredibly slow and laggy. Opening any tab takes anything between 15-30 seconds. Frequently doesn't respond to actions at all and then you have to keep tapping multiple times until it reacts. Little bit disappointed with the updates. I will come back and revise if situation changes."
"I have been a customer for over 15 years, the service has been very good , anytime I have spoken with staff at the glenrothes branch they have been very helpful and professional. I had my account hacked years ago and they had replaced the money stolen without me contacting them, their security department staff were also very good. I have and still do recommend them to others."
Very good service!!! Very secure!!! Completely rely on it.. don't even go bank unless it's necessary.
"Great app, easy to use, best business bank there is 💪🏽"
"Way better than any bank in Spain im terms of offered services, options, exchange rates and customer service"
"Essential, especially in these difficult days"
Always a good experience - outstanding service
Geting the Hang of it.
"Currency exchange in real time without commissions is the strong point of this current account. You can have multiple currencies on the same account at no cost. The credit card has no commission whatsoever if you withdraw up to 200 euros in the case of someone like me who has the standard account. Furthermore, I paid only 30 euros a year for international medical insurance, on the internet I did not find prices below 60 euros, everything is done from the app in a simple and ultra transparent way. There are no surprises of any kind. For now the 🔝 of virtual accounts."
"works perfectly fine and is very useful with a lot of different things that you can do to make the whole banking thing easier. however it’s very slow and annoying to use as the loading times are longer than you’d expect. also when you go off the app and go back onto it within 2 seconds you would need to sign back in which is understandable for security but it needs more leniency. all in all, very good app."
Very easy. Very satisfying. 😉
"When the High Street Banks started their Red Tap BS, Chatterbank cut to the chase and stepped in. I know it’s early days and they are surely working to add more services but so far, they outshined the High Street Bureaucratic Bank"
Excellent I recommend it
"Good banking app but why the constant trying to get me to take out a loan. If I close the loan advert it just comes back next time I log in. Very annoying.
By the way, it crashed on startup after I upgraded to a new iPhone. If you get a new phone, you will probably have to uninstall the app then reinstall it again; which is highly annoying as I then had to go to my local Barclays cash point to finish the installation."
Nifty!
Nice and satisfying
So easy. So useful. Great.
"Please bring back the ""Available Balance"" on the account overview screen. That was very handy, instant information. Don't understand why you've taken it down?"
this app is very easy to operate and offers all the services that I need.we
Very useful and easy to use the application suitable for all ages
not bad very usefull
"App worked fine until I reluctantly downloaded the latest IOS update and now it just times out and won’t open, even after reinstalling"
Loving the app so easy and convenient see all our A/C s without going to the bank or having statements sent paying in cheques so easy too thank you Barclays
I Happy for all services really
It does its job
"Update 3.40: Dynamic account balance for standing orders still hasn't come back, although I've been promised it for months. New design is messed up. And you get a notification of a standing order once by mail and once via app. With several standing orders per day you have a lot of notifications from N26. I would like a response from support.

Update 3.39: Dynamic account balance for standing orders still unavailable. Design has deteriorated a bit. To get to the graphical statistics you now have to type twice.

07.01.2019 Final Word/Faziz: Customer requests are not implemented in a timely manner and there are not so many new updates.

As of 03.01.2019: Still no update.
As of Dec 24, 2019: No update

"Using Starling in Europe is great as there are no transactional fees, also when you spend any money you are alerted. Overall it’s easy and great compared to any other bank I’ve used!"
Brilliant way of transferring or paying bills. Keep up the good work
"I have been blocked out of my account, the app keeps refusing my password asking for my pin number as part of the authentication process."
"The old app was good it has now been upgraded by force to an app that doesn’t work and when it does the layout is poor. I could get lots of info like my iban no, personal I’d no etc. on the old app. This is so poor I’m thinking of moving banks."
Its a very good card :) The experience with them is very positive.
Does not work with the Google Pixel 3's finger print sensor.
Absolutely atrocious can't even get my Santander mobile banking updated what a disgrace
no card it's almost 3 weeks and now I can't login....BS App
The best ! Makes my life easier
Great new way to bank I'm delighted with all the features.
"Only just joined. So far so good.. shame I can't put money to one side for direct debits etc like I could with the bank I'm transferring from (psst pots?? ) other than that seems OK. UPDATE been using it a month now, all good except the spending categories are rubbish. Why can't I edit or add my own. Most of them don't fit my lifestyle ...."
The app helps with my basic banking needs.
Ace. Bank stuff on your phone. If you are young you won't appreciate the inconvenience of going to a bank and doing everything with a quill and parchment. Get this app it's ace as I'm sure all other banking apps.
Always perfect and very fast.
Everything it does. It does right. No messing about. Clear and easy plus it’s a great idea
this bank is disgusting
"... nach dem anderen. Ich weiß nicht wie lange es her ist, dass es hier wirkliche Innovationen gab. Und damit meine ich nicht den Umzug zur eigenen Bank, der für mich als User nur Arbeit bedeutet hat. Es gibt so ein Potenzial, coole und nützliche Features zu bringen (die euch eure Kunden zu Haufe auch mitteilen - siehe Twitter) ... aber alles was man so als Update bekommt, sind ""nicht sichtbare Verbesserungen"". Langsam wird es enttäuschend und langweilig. Auch euer Wettbewerb arbeitet intensiv an verbesserten Apps. Euer USP, innovativer und cooler als andere Banken zu sein, wird immer kleiner."
simple to use and saves time
"Very handy, user-friendly, best FX rates."
"Dis is gut , di gorilla like"
"Very good service, efficient support."
"Really good service, much better support than the traditional banks and just a pleasure to use.

The only issue I have is that aren't a lot of ways to visualise my spending (e.g. timeseries of my balance for a period) and there is still not a fully functional web version, which would be very handy."
Horrible service hard to get a hold of customer support. So far the past couple of weeks nothing has worked properly and don't take instacash the day you get paid they will take it right back charge the 3.99 then when I didn't understand what happened I tried it again and it put me delinquent on my payment the second I took it and now I can't use instacash cause their system said I was late on payments since the day I took the instacash loan and they won't help I'm just screwed
Couldn't live without this app it's simple to use and saves me time. Best app in my phone .i would be lost without it
Working better now
This app is awesome. I no longer use traditional banking because of it. It has all the perks of a normal bank plus a few extras. All without actually ever having to step foot in a bank. 5/5 easily.
"Superb for travellers as it works all over the place in local currency, effectively with no fees for foreign payments. But they keep adding more and more crud to the app. I don't want crypto, gold or silver, I just want to be able to find the banking features I use, yet every layer of crud makes it harder and harder."
I recently lost my card in Vietnam and not only was I able to freeze my card directly in the app with no trouble in case I found it; when I didn’t find it I was able to order a replacement completely no hassle and it came within a week special delivery to Vietnam! Nothing but kind worlds to say about the customer support and wouldn’t hestitate to recommend to a friend.
"Simple, all online, simple notifications and the support team is brilliant, Uber responsive and helpful"
Works very well and the bonus arrived right away
2 months after last update and STILL can't make any payments on it as freezes when press confirm.
Almost...N26 would be almost perfect if only they were compatible with Samsung Pay like everyone else and they mama. Get with the times N26!
Can't ask for more from a mobile (only) banking.
Fingerprint issue no longer happening. 5 stars 🌟
Brilliant. Couldn't do without it now
This app allows me to transfer easily on the go!! Gets better with every update!! :-)
so far I'm loving it
"Honestly as a bank they are a joke I can't count the amount of times they've let me down or given me ridiculous charges, the 123 credit accounts are there purely to make money out of you with limited benefits. And their online security is a joke, which locks you totally out for the most ridiculous of things which then leads to charges because you can't access anything. I wish I'd never left HSBC
."
Ideal for what I need from a banking app.
superb so easy to use and well thought out
"I have had an excellent experience with Natwest in all of the years I have been banking with them. They have always been there for me, sometimes in difficult times. Brilliant!"
"is god, then"
Very handy app!! Easy to use and understand. Hopefully it will help me manage my money a little better!!
"I've been using Chatterbank for over a year now and I really like it. I mostly use it in while abroad, but I also used it on occasions on my home country. PROs: - better exchange rate - analysis on what I spent - vaults to save money for different purposes - instant &amp; no tax money transfer CONs: - a couple of times my transactions were refused without any apparent reason - one time bug that doubled my tansactions for the day, I received the money back in less than 48 hrs"
"A great service, easy to use and fast transactions.
I is a true alternative to a classic bank account and with more options provided"
Transfers and payments are rather long winded compared to other banking apps 😢 but it is perfectly functional.
"Extremely satisfied, lets me do and check what ever I need, very happy with it."
best of the best bank that's what I call it Santander yeah he have good rate them
"Much better off with the competition, nightmare to set up, not friendly user interface and no way to contact customer service for assistance. 

Tried to verify account with ID and failed twice, Will now not allow to change it to a passport, nightmare."
Impossible to open a bank account. The operator who speaks with the customer to verify the identity has a sound relay issue and can't continue the video call. Rubbish. Update AFTER staff replies: my Internet connection had better upload speed than most WiFi hotspots and my ping was around 50% better. I did hear the operator but she said it was impossible to continue the verification process. The device is able to carry with heavy tasks. Your App doesn't work as it SHOULD do. Bye bye.
"Every time there's an update the app seems to reset itself and you have to go through the same routine of calling the bank, reset your password, getting your activation code. I must have done this on 10+ occasions. I've stopped using it now, I'm back to telephone banking!"
Constant problems logging in will be changing banks
New experience online banking...
Works very well. I would like the possibility to access via pc also
I did not have ancoea received my card but already I could shop online and above all share money with my friends! Really a great service especially for who travels often
absoulty brilliant wish I had done this sooner thk you
This app seems VERY USEFUL/HELPFUL . I've just recently started using so I'm still exploring. Will most likely give 5 stars once I get into using it more. Very easy to navigate on all fronts so far.
Fairly happy
"LIKED this app till 56 of may 😩 after I found out that I shouldn't UPDATE, you guys started to design an absoluyelg unhelpful interface which is asdolutely worst than the one from the start, I don't understand why need to modify into something MORE unhelpful if something that lasted a couple of years it was perfect 😡 all the infose aren't shown you need to tap 'show all' then the important actions are far from accessibility ! you guys don't give a damn about me as a customer right? still same"
i will never be banking with them ever again they are the worst building society that have ever existed on planet earth i opened my account back in June 2018 everything was fine nothing was wrong with my account i have ADHD and dyslexia so on my online banking i wanted my bank statements to come on my phone but i dont check them as a teenager who checks there bank statement. Now on May i cannot remember the exact date someone sent me a payment of 90 pounds i thought it was my friend the only people who have my account number and sort code are my parents and some of my friends i asked my friends who sent me the money one of them said they did so i didn't bother about it or worry as it was only 90 pounds but they lied my account number and sort code was used for payment then on June 18th on the website shpock i put an item up for sale for 80 pounds the buyer paid straight away and wanted the item straight away so i was going to post the next day as the time was  3pm then all of a sudden like 2 minutes go by my online banking app restarts and i see it shows i have no accounts to display i was panicking and i immediately called nationwide they said there was a report of a fraudulent credit i was shocked i then knew this buyer is a scammer how can someone send an item to you when you just placed the order today that doesn't make sense so then i was told my account will be closed in 60 days i was actually devastated  and angry i went to my local branch to see what was going on there was this guy i hated him soo much he was a rude person he spoke to me like i am some sort of criminal a convict i walked out of the bank angry i will never be banking with them again. I dont recommend anyone to bank with nationwide.
Best foreign exchange. Secure instant peer to peer settling. Downside of the card is surcharge for dynamic exchange on weekends which you have to watch out for
All good with them. Awesome service
"Hello, very fast and helpful service"
"HSBC doesn't even deserve that one Star if I could I would give it a no Star. 

No regard for Bank Client. Shambolic Customer service. 
Each member of staff have different set of information and rules get changes from person to person as they go by. Always get excuses for not getting the request done. Query will have to be repeated many times to different individuals, wait is exorbitantly long. request get transfers from one department to another online  chat to online messages to different phone lines and no one owns it as it will mean to do some work. Each staff behave as trainee or intern with little or no knowledge. It happened multiple time and cost me load of money for not getting the information from my own account. In future not Banking with HSBC. In my experience Corner shops are better organised then HSBC. Painful experience."
"I hate that the app doesn’t open unless you update it, I’m on holidays with slow internet and can’t make a payment cause the app won’t download the new version, you shouldn’t be blocked out of the app you have already installed for an update"
This app is so easy and convenient to use. All the info you need and more Well done Lloyds
Not impressed when trying to up date
"When I have questions, you’re always by my side ‘"
I have not been able to use the app for the last few days and despite the announcement that it is all fixed I am still unable to use the app. I have tried to log into my account through the computer and cannot pass the first page showing the balance. No option to get in touch with anyone it is disappointing! It used to be very easy to use but now it makes impossible to make a simple payment
The easyJet’s way to sort out your finances superb
Easy to use unlike a of banking apps
"Great account. Everything is very easy to manage, and if you have something and need help, help is not far on different channels."
"Very easy to use, really awesome"
At last a banking app that is getting towards the easy end of the scale to use.   Banking apps have two problems.   Getting in and finding out what process you need to get what you want done.   This app has a good go at resolving these two usage areas.   Not perfect but a good couple of steps in the right direction
I can not change my phone number
great so far but the interface takes some getting used to
"Great experience!!! Would appreciate an automatic exchange of the available amount in the currency of the location/ countries when we are traveling! Otherwise, all good;)!"
"quick,easy to use, clear, all Good"
"Easy and fast! I use Monese to recieve funds from all over Europe and after an initial hiccup everything works like it has been greased..
Maria on the help live chat line is terrific helping with  all my enquiries.
10/10.5 stars."
Great 🏦 banking app hopefully they keep improving this app further. Better than NatWest though.
This is very very old UI... guys pls pls refer how other banks are doing and change it...
"The login could not be completed. It failed the videoident. No reply to my mail. 
Addendum: Now the VideoIdent has worked."
"Such an easy way to manage my accounts, I am delighted with this service"
They've ruined it because they cant leave it alone. Services are still good but UI too painful now.
Poor to date
"Best bank ever! 
There isn’t really anything else I can say."
"Why do the latest update require access to a microphone to record audio and view all my wifi connections, Its a banking app!!"
"Since upgrading to Android 10 on a OnePlus 7 this app has become very buggy. Randomly crashes, only shows a white screen. Removed and reinstalled and it's still the same, reset device and reinstalled and still buggy. Took four attempts to create and pay a new payee, and each time it crashed had to start from scratch. Used to be a good app, not any longer."
It is a very good app that helps and makes things much easier
The app is really helpful
"Everything understandable and if there are problems, it will be clarified quickly. Excellent!"
We driving Flow Flow
"Great service great way to keep in touch with your money 
Only suggestion is some times get an email I have correspondences but can not access them on my phone 
This is the future of banking great service thankyou"
Best accont in uk
"Excellent way of banking, great way to keep track of movement of money. Love the goals which is savings."
So easy to use .some other banks. should do the same thing .I love it.makes life less stressfull but sad its makeing banks shut.
The facility to pay in a cheque looked useful - however I couldn’t get it to work.  It eventually took a picture of the front of the cheque but refused to take one of the rear. Useless!  Goes along with various other bugs and frustrations though the app had its uses....
I really like it ! Everything is simple ja quick
"Really good bank I think! Much easier to use thrn than any original bank Halifax, really good features and layout, use this as my main account now. Only negative, (which is affected me directly 3 times now!!) Is the card service being down. Not just for an hour but twice is was down for over 4 hours which is pretty bad when you technically can't access your money. Part from that one important issue it's a really good bank and very unique with notifications of spending"
Free £100 just for switching. Have had my main current account with TSB for years and had no issues. Also pays 3% credit interest. To get the £100 bonus simply email me at jsccope1993@gmail dot com
"Brilliant bank! Use the card at home but especially on holiday, no additional fees and the wholesale Interbank FX rate of exchange. Transfer money directly to your foreign bank for very low fees. Keep an eye on everything on the app, so easy.
I cannot praise them enough."
"Best bank for me, and for better use you just have to respect the CGU of N26, Thank you N26!"
easy to use and saves messing about trying to get to the bank
Best app for money/bank
Really why aren't you using Monzo? Much better than a traditional bank and getting smarter all the time.
Closed all the local town branches so now it’s at least a one hour round car journey to get to one!
"Once logged in, which sometimes takes a few attempts, the service is good."
Really usefull considering how disapointing the physical banks have been
"This app is basically designed as a secure token for logging into the desktop version. You can check balances, but even the ability to schedule transfers between accounts is going away (never been able to make bank to bank transfers). 
For a bank that is designed towards online banking, they have a very poor mobile banking platform."
doesn't work with my Samsung 10e after logging in pretty much shuts down before I can use it was good on s9
Samsung fixed its finger print issue. All banks re enabled it except FD. Please fix it
very useful and... free
"HSBC's homebanking, security and access implementation is the poorest and most elaborated of all I've tried."
Waited for 4 hours but Danny eventually got back to me and was very helpful.
"Generally a hastle free experience, although I would suggest using desktop for transferring larger amounts."
"I am travelling soon to Switzerland and France, and would find this useful to switch currencies without having to got to a currency exchange place"
Does all I could ask of it
The calendar that shows up on the login page would require me to click over 500 times to get to my birthday. Useless.
"Very good. One or two things difficult to find in the app and sometimes it crashes or is slow, but I am very satisfied."
Why can I not use this app without granting phone access permissions? Looks to me like Barclays app deliberately reading and sending my call history. I am perfectly capable of using my phone to perform calls thank you very much. I do not need to do it within the app.
It s good and very well
It just works ... well!!
so so BAD
Great all I could ask for
"Very tacky and dificult to use, navigate, and find information. The absolute worst app compare to all the other Australian banks I've used. Please improve."
"Problem with the app: after adding another fingerprint to the device, the app keep asking for memorable information as opposed to allowing to log in with fingerprint. Very frustrating. Even logging in with memorable characters, which should reset the app accepting fingerprint next time it won't work. Please fix this. Other than that the app is excellent as always been."
Find it to be an absolutely brilliant service and love the way their exchange rates when travelling abroad. They have some of the best features in the app like the vault feature and transferring money to your friends on Chatterbank pretty much instantaneously. Their customer service team are also great whenever I have needed to use them .
I more satisfied with Chatterbank than I am with my regular bank. To the point that I am thinking to ditch the regular bank...
"More often than not when I open the app and the usual sign in screen loads up the screen becomes useless so I can’t type in my pin or use my fingerprint. Usually resetting my phone once or twice fixes it but it is a mild inconvenience. The app is great other than that though I have no complaints.

Edit: since the updates this problem has been resolved and I now have no problem with the app so giving it a 5 star"
"Never been disappointed yet, and I have always been looked after."
How easy and user friendly is this new app. So much quicker to use. Well thought out.
"Easy and intuitive, gets better with every update!"
I have used Yorkshire bank for many years without any trouble and now use there phone banking it is an excellent service always available 24/7 never have any promlems
Straight forward and useful
So far it has been a very useful tool to manage my finances. But I still worry about hackers getting into my account . I installed the app 10 months ago and it has revolutionised my account management.
It does what I need it to do so it's great
"Unfortunately this app is falling behind its competitors more and more. It is starting to feel like a relic of an older era.

Modern banks like Starling have a considerably better app experience in every way.

I also do not want to see advertisements for low interest, poorly thought out accounts or loans and credit cards every time I log into this miserable app just to view my transactions.

Additionally as an investor in Lloyd’s, I am seriously starting to doubt where you are heading."
"Poor usability design. I can't make an urgent website payment before I get a security code from this app. I can't get the code cause I am forced to update the app before using it. i cant update the app because I started an all app update a few minutes ago. Why are we forced to update the app before using it. This often happens when I'm in town, away from my Wi-Fi in fact... I use the app version so seldom... it's every time I want use the app I HAVE to update it. How do I reply to Nick's answer?"
"Monzo are the best. If you don't have a Monzo card, you are missing out. It is the future of banking and the card rules. I enjoy their community - lots of passionate people with great ideas."
I have Motorola g7 and apparently reading the comments many have Motorola and we can not use it until they update the application. Please do it
Better than my physical bank.
Always fast Always straight Forward. So SO convenient. Brilliant.
Loved the app user friendly. Didn't like the last update in which they eliminate the option of dates selection while viewing the transactions.
They work on and off some time App not responding and I can’t go in please sort out. Many thanks
I think mobile banking is great.
"It doesn't put the app on my home page, so I have to open it by the app store ! It happened when I updated it , it was there before."
"brilliant app to use everyday and when on holiday, let's you know exactly what you've spent and where instantly."
easy access but securely logged in
Radically better
I go on my phone to do mobile banking and I see the rainbow colours on the Barclays logo. I’m so offended that I’ve deleted the app until it until it goes back to normal. I don’t want to be celebrating pride every time I unlock my phone.
livelihood
perfect to use 👌👌
"Useful app with useful features I don't find in other banking apps. Push notifications are great, linked up with ifttt to automate a spreadsheet!"
"Excellent service, so convenient when abroad. I highly recommend!"
"Very slow, poor UX, long on-boarding process, very limited features and functionality. HSBC need to take a long hard look at any other banking app and make some much needed changes."
"Very clear and easy to use, really helpful app."
"Barclays is an amazing bank and importantly, staff provides excellent customer service every time I call.  I would like to thank Alex Byrne for all her help and support."
"There are a number of things wrong with this app which seems to be evidence of poor quality assurance testing:

1.  When you select log off the app returns to the login page and if you have face recognition activated will automatically log you back in if face visible.  Other bank apps whilst returning to the log on page do not then initiate the log in process.

I have advised Barclays of this issue over multiple releases since face recognition introduced.  No feedback received or correction implemented.

2.  Two weeks ago the app forced me to log in to the web site to change my 5 digit passcode.  I can no longer access the app because the new passcode is not recognised.

I have advised Barclays but to no avail.  

I am using the latest versions of Barclays app and iOS."

"TSB demonstrates an inability to handle a complaint or accept feedback from its customer's.

Furthermore, they are in clear breach of Principle 7 (PRIN 2.1.1.7 - Communications with clients) of the Financial Conduct Authority handbook which outlines...

""A firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its clients, and communicate information to them in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.""

TSB expect their customer's to login into their bank account on a daily basis to monitor an inbox that they store electronic communication for you to read. This is an unreasonable expectation.

Whilst privacy is an important factor, a simple email to a real mailbox informing us that there is a message waiting would resolve this issue. A basic and common sense solution which would not cost them anything except for the initial development of this feature.

As a result I was not made aware of banking fees that where deducted from my account. The bank has a duty to inform us of these charges.

It's a shame that there is no common sense in this organisation. As a result I have now transferred to First Direct."
I downloaded the app on Tuesday and signed up. However I wait for 3 days that my account is verified. So one opens his account in 8 minutes is definitely not.
since update can not change contactless card
"Used to work but now I get ""Something went wrong, please try again later"" when trying to log in"
"The best one out there, bye-bye my regular bank!"
"Frankly in all honesty, the best known bank I have used, even becoming my primary bank."
"Modern and comfortable way of banking, excellent conditions especially for payments abroad. I'm satisfied."
a very useful application. make life easier...
"This is the first time that I have created an app only bank account. I am a little wary of such opportunities as I do not hold a high opinion of the effectiveness of IT. However, I was delighted with the ease of applying via the app and most impressed with how Atom were able to confirm my identity. The app works better than I expected and the communication with the bank via the app was rapid. The technology is impressive and reassuring. So far I am delighted with Atom Bank."
"All great, I personally would love the display in night mode. Maybe a little food for thought. Update: Dark mode is here, thank you. 👍 👍 👍"
It is the best app
"Urgently needs an update, app keeps saying no Internet connection."
Stop working after yesterday update and made me embarrassed when i was trying to buy my lunch and pay for it with my mobile phone. Call them 3 times nothing today they kept me waiting for 7 minutes on live chat with no replies. And I'm done with Barclays tomorrow I'm going to switch with any other bank out there but not Barclays
Love this app helped me out a lot thank you so much whoever the creator is deserves big hug
Honestly a disgrace. Waited 2 hours over 3 -4 days each time and still waiting. In the end just give up.
Really helpful team. Awesome app
"Only the Dispo-feature has been realized in the “update” for Austria. No savings, no new Cash Map like the update log states. I should really get back to my old bank."
"Can't even log in. 'Enter username or personal access number' not knowing my personal access number I entered my username which has always worked on my old phone, was met with 'the personal access code entered is incorrect'. Personally I have had enough with HSBC's utter uselessness and will be moving banks so the services provided to me actually work."
Doesn't even let u make an account
It would be great but the credit page is blank and doesn’t show anything. I’ve updated and reinstalled and the app and credit page is still just blank
Still love it it does what it says on the tin no problems with it brilliant and safe
Till date best experience . UI is very much user friendly. Love the App
"Really awesome firm, quick to answear anf alot of cool features like the nicest steel card you could imagine ;*"
"I have been with nationwide for around 3 years. Only now after starting to use the account actively I have learnt that their security system is utter garbage!! I have the app on my phone which logs me in with face ID, I also have the card in my hand, yet I need a passnumber in order to log into my account. Or a stupid little calculator?? Who in the right mind carries around a nationwide calculator everywhere they go?? For security to log in they want a passnumber and to text you a verification code. Why so much security, who is gonna have my phone, card, and login number and then ring up answering all the other security questions correctly and still not being able to log in online because they have to send a passnumber through the post! It's 2020, why would you send it through the post! If anyone is looking to go to a bank, dont let it be nationwide, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!"
"Very happy, no complaints."
This app is fairly easy to use and is good for keeping track of your balance and making payments but it says on the santander website that you can cash cheques using the app. You can't. There's not even an option for it. Totally misleading and inconvenient; especially when you can't get into a branch or the post office or anything to cash the cheque by hand.
Brilliant gets better all the time. Unfortunately spoke too soon latest updates are a step backwards.
I am currently unable to log into my app. I need to confirm some card details. This is frustrating
Good that
It's quite good and practicably reliable.
"Hello, I am a new customer, but before I became your client, I read a lot of positive feedback. I hope I'm happy with you. Thank you and a nice day. Good luck"
Fabulous its easy to use even for me lol.
Best for managing and transferring money
Excellent FE banking platform. Easy and rapid to use
Excellent for mobile banking
"Find this app consistently easy and user friendly, and invaluable...particularly now during Covid19 Lockdown. Would be helpful to be able to pay in cheques using camera as is possible with eg Barclays app."
So far so good. Ordered wrong card accidentally. Issue resolved by live agent within minutes.cheers.
"Very useful, if travelling aboard"
Most excellent and easy t use
"I have banked with Natwest all my life and am moving backs because they just don't care about their customers.  They closed the branch in our town and said it was OK because  the one in the next town 4 miles away would pick up the slack.  One year later they closed that one.

We now have a 40 minute round trip to get to a bank and have to pay to park."
"Very helpful, efficient and enjoyable"
"So far so good ! No fees when putting money in your account, quick transactions! Great!"
This app used to be great but since updating both the app and iOS it crashes as soon as I try to open it. Have deleted and reinstalled but still same problem persists :(
Easy to use. Love fingerprint recognition. Transfers easy.
Extremely sufficiently useful.. More than a Bank account.
"Very frustrating. Won't scan a cheque, don't waste your time trying. Barclays seem to be aware of the problem but released the app anyway."
Great app so easy access now with youre pin to sign in +++
I am very pleased with the coins
"The best bank of which I have been a client until now in my life!
Ultra-fast and comfortable service, keeps you informed in real-time and record of your operations, very safe for transactions, and I have even been surprised that I have earned money!
Highly recommended."
easy smooth very useful
"I'm sorry that you've been bothering, I've awarded 5 stars and I thought that, to such an assessment, there is nothing more to add"
"This new app is rubbish. Doesn’t let you log in, saying details are wrong where they are not. Old app was better."
Upgraded my phone to Huawei mate 9 n app won't even open!! Please fix barclays
"New customer and impressed, so far so good."
Beware if you are getting this to use the free international transfer facility. My first attempt was returned failed after 2 weeks minus a CAD50 fee. Customer service was poor and slow to respond. After 6 days of “investigating” they told me Chatterbank cannot make this payment (to a major credit union in Canada) because they are an unrecognised 3rd party (quite concerning) and suggested I use my personal bank account instead (Halifax were able to process the transfer no problem and funds received in Canada in less than 24hrs albeit with the usual fees). They also refused to refund the 50 dollar fee that I was charged despite admitting that the reason for failed transfer was out of my control. Needless to say I am deleting this app.
"This app is amazing, I can solve all I need, easy to use, efficient and always giving choice to update for a better experience."
"Absolute disaster! They just freeze your money and nothing happens anymore. Man has no way to contact or defend himself. They then want extremely private data such as tax returns, payroll and account details, even though the money was paid in by a legitimate Swiss bank and is a relatively small amount. These are mafia methods under the guise of their regulation, but no other credit card does that!! Finger away!!!

It already appears in the standard text that you keep posting as an apology. I also read that they are censoring bad commentaries on their forum and exclude the users.

Really bad!! Finger off, or your money will be gone soon! I haven't seen my money or heard anything until today!"
Impossible to deposit cheques except by post.
For now it seems very well!
Latest update again breaks the app again - every time you open credit card the app crashes
"Great for using whilst overseas, no charges on purchases and free cash withdrawals!"
Cool online banking. Excellent for transfers
go
Latest update did not kill the application for me. And appears to have more useful functions.
Excellently Updated App. Loved it.
Received the card a few days after my request and loaded it with an amount in CHF. The first cash withdrawal in France was not a problem and the commission-free withdrawal of EUR was made at a very good conversion rate.
It works perfectly.bravo
"I am loving this app, wow!! It's so helpful when you need some extra cash on those broke days...thank you!!!!"
The latest update has broken the app. I deleted it and re downloaded it and still can’t login. Please get this fixed ASAP
"An incredible interface, intuitive and with a very competitive speed. Chatterbank is a great banking alternative"
Is great! What isn’t told is you only get $125 then you have to pay off your full amount before you get the $375.  Really great if you need money!
"This is not a good service but you won't find out until you've taken advance several times. I did and now stuck in some weird loop. Tried to transfer to virtual card and it won't let me. Something about an external account. Well duh! That's how you deposit Instacash to my account. First Instacash advance was a good amount, then it went to 190.00. My deposits haven't changed and my paybacks are in full each time. Now I am at zero?? WTH? Canceling tomorrow morning."
Works banking app. Constantly getting locked out before I even attempt a login. Never had issues with other banks
Good app as a whole but paying in a cheque it never accepts the picture and it was a cheque from Barclays. Tells me to take it to a branch so what's the point of that part of the app.
Quite good for the things you nneed to do day to day but you still need to go to the website for some things.
Very good mobile app Touch ID cool and updates run quick for transfers
"Generally good service, except I have once or twice encountered difficulty getting in touch with your help desk."
Great account and opened with ease. Amazing!
something is always happing be it a glitch or something but i cant access my bank stuff and im really considering switching banks cause this is always happening. and also i only bank with moneylion i cant get a loan cause moneylion isnt an option to choose
"Very good bank with defiant prices all expensive and null French banks, no fees taking into account powerful and modern card free, full of options the debit rejection fees are attractive only downside no physical agency in France damage otherwise everything is well in this bank very serious and honest I highly recommend it"
"Load of rubbish since update ,phoned Barclays an they say new app can only be used with android 8.1"
My experience is always good on mobile phone and inside my local branch which happens to be hereford keep up the great job you always do
good service on cards
"Worst bank ever! I had an account and I made a switch a few months ago. I tried to open a new account now and the bank does not allow this for 1 year as a punishment! Very unacceptable policy, in all other banks you're free to open a new account again after a very short amount of time if you change your mind. At Starling, they just find it fair to penalize you because you decided to leave the Bank in the past, instead of being supportive & give you extra motives to join them! Very disappointing"
"The biometric login is too close to the thumbprint and can be pressed accidentally, otherwise I feel safe using it."
Love it but the home page needs more updates
Can’t believe a company that deals in perfection supports a elitist product protectionist racket who’s likes to the corrupt Bein Sports is above all.
Great for travel and shopping via Internet.
Excellent app and better than main competitors by far; recent release has removed the ability to rename your accounts within the app which is the only negative
I cannot download this new app therefore my HSBC mobile banking is not available
"Have tried 3 times to open an account. When I receive an email, it automatically deletes itself leading me being unable to open. won't bother now."
N26 is very user friendly and I have enjoyed using this bank.
"This is a brilliant application that has made my life so much easier. I can see all of my accounts from anywhere on my phone, transfer money between them, pay in cheques, etc. Would find life much harder without it. If you have a Barclays account and do not have this app, get it installed, you won't regret it!"
so easy .so convienant .
I use the app for all my day to day banking needs and would be lost without it.
"I really like this app.
It’s so convenient to pay bills. Check balances. Move money.
Very user friendly 👍"
I can no longer switch between my 2 accounts at the login screen as I was able to do with the previous version!
Latest update is horrible. Cannot find my dashboard and currency prices. My watch list disappeared 😕 . Now Chatterbank becomes useless for me
Thank you very conformally done everything
Good app an service
Very helpful due to memory problems
"I've had my phone for 3 years and I have installed Santander App upon it since then. I've always kept up to date with App updates. However, My App reported that my phone appears to be rooted this morning without having rooted the app. Indeed I used the same App last night. I performed a rooting check and the report say my phone has not been rooted. Yet, I am unable to use the App as it terminate on the first screen with the message ""Your device appears to be rooted......."" Please help"
Is what I am looking for!
Never had any trouble yet
"After the latest update I cannot login anymore. It throws 00006 error. Not to mention the fact that even before I wasn't able to use the fingerprint login feature. And not much is being done to address the issues. And please don't ask me to get in touch on Facebook, because the people there will respond after a week and their response is ""I'm sorry that we cannot help you"". So, please provide a solid and meaningful way of reporting this issue and getting it fixed (an email address would do)"
Top notch stuff
Por ahora todo bien
I really like this app. Since i have been using the mobile app i don't have to do banking on computer. U can do anything from the mobile app. I cant say any wrong about it amd its constantly improving. Great app 5 🌟
Great for sending money for split bills or anything and hassle free transfering from Currency to currency!
Useful app but seems to have recently removed the Transunion credit score function which I had found useful.
Update has broken it can't log in .. what happened was a press release from the management . Times article and rushed release without QA. Fix please
Love it just the job
Very good option. App very easy to use.
using TSB and Lloyds apps.no problems with Lloyds but TSB having problems with logging in very often.
Good service for travelling abroad and great way to pay online in many currencies. However the app has some bugs. But the customer service is very good and fast.
"Bonus 10 euro for those who register and make a purchase with a card of the same amount or higher code: ⭐alessiov3607⭐ I have been using the account for more than a year, easy and excellent to use, my experience is very positive, the card comes in few days, so the staff is serious, transfers and withdrawals from ATMs are free. I use the business account because it gives a small 0.1% cashback on expenses of any kind."
"Very very very bad service. Lying lying and lying. 
When ever I pay for anything issue. No statements
Unhelpful"
Nice and easy and quick to use
"Major ongoing issues
Major ongoing issues! AVOID! I have over £2000 frozen in an account due to apparent security issues!! I am a UK tax paying citizen and have show multiple proofs of this and they still have not released my money. Absolute shambles of a help desk, this has been ongoing for 2 weeks now. Once my money is released I will be closing the account and complaining to the financial ombudsman"
Have been so simple to use and intuitive. A great customer experience and have never had any issues. Really impressed by the simple human way that they communicate with no big bank bull. Great work all!
"New update don't work on my phone, don't delete the old one"
Very semple
Update on 3rd August. Apple Watch still fails every day due to “technical app error” on IOS devices. Once app on IOS is restarted and used Apple Watch is ok. Until the next day then it fails again! Very unusable app currently. Please sort the bug out.
Very easy and fast to use once logged in.
Immediate conversion at excellent FX rates; surprisingly user friendly and easy-to-use app and service.
"for me in jon
Useful
SWIFT"
"The best bank ever. No monthly fees, lots of features, helpful support. I did not regret the day, when I join them."
"Under Apple Pay, it works great. I can exchange currency at the best exchange rate. Free interbank transfers, free cash withdrawals of 75000HUF per month take everything! Instant sending money from friends with RevoluTos, throwing out accounts is a very good thing."
I've used this app for a while but since the last update can't seem to log on!whats gone wrong?
"Do not use, I’m taking this further as they should be shut down..

I’ve sold all my furniture at auctions, online etc.. all money went into monzo 

Next thing you know, they’ve stopped me banking with them and froze my money 

5k To be precise 

I’m part of a monzo group now and this has happened to loads of people, I’ll be tweeting this out.
This will reach 200k followers I have alone on twitter, time to stop these

Stick to high street banks"
"So like many users are saying, the app is good but their latest update is now very slow in loading and sometimes freezes. I contacted the app support team and they told me the problem is either with my WiFi amd data connection. So basically my phone is problem. Maybe now with all these complaints, they'll take notice and accountability."
Awesome app I couldn’t be without it
Too many security questions to remember. You can easily get locked out. Its ridiculous
"Used to work, now virtually useless... Ever since the most recent updates the app still loads but now crashes EVERYTIME I attempt to select a payee to make a payment. Can now only use app to check/manage balances/transactions. P.s. i have unistalled/reinstalled app to no avail. UPDATE: problem solved (i think)... Turns out the app (probably for security reasons) does not take kindly to being overridden by certain 'developer options'."
"Without this I couldn't get wrecked, thank you barclays and the Rothschild family you've served me well x"
"I am writing to express my utter upset as having been a customer for many years I decided to close my account in 2016 However, in November 2017 to apply for a new account which was opened but subsequently, closed. 

I appreciate that a bank can choose who they may wish to do business with however, surely there has to be reasonable grounds to exit a customer. As I've not done anything wrong I truly feel upset by the decision and in all in honestly I would love for my account to be reviewed and opened again.

As this has and does cause me a lot of anxiety as it makes wonder what kind of person you have me down to be."
Changed my banking experience from shiet to awesome
"I have a black card for a few months, I travel a lot in various parts of the world and I use it regularly, I never found any difficulty. Withdrawals are free everywhere and notifications arrive in real time anywhere"
"I have paid in a few cheques in the past but each after a number of attempts to take a photo the process deems acceptable but I have now not been able to pay a cheque in for over three months. During this time there have been a few upgrades to the app and each time I excitedly hope the cheque photo taking issues have been resolved but each time I am disappointed. Why can’t you just fix this and get it to work like other banking apps do? So frustrating, especially at this time."
I haven’t received an answer as to why I can’t have a business bank account. I love the service otherwise
Lovely simple banking experience. Perfect for use with Google Pay on the mobile.
Well thought out process. It was super easy to get an account and the agents throughout the process were helpful.  It all went smoothly and clearly.
Can do much with it as cant set up direct debits
"** PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT AN LGBT TRANS FRIENDLY BUSINESS **

this bank is Anti Transgender do not bank here , i am moving my accounts as soon as i Can. Do not be fooled by their LGBT stand that they care 4 us they do not , reported to them direct received some BS apology"
"I am a new user, but until now only have good things to say. Very fast and simple to create an account, add money, open account in different currencies and ordering a physical card for free.
And even the 10chf bonus for inviting friends was perfect.
Many thanks to the developers"
"Easy to use, it was added an important dimension to the level of service provided by Santander."
"For certain things it works very well, but it has happened to me that I am charged twice for the same transaction and after a week I have not received a response from customer service. I have also had a problem with an ATM that has finally been solved, but with the uncertainty of not knowing if I lost the money. For small things I will continue to use it, but without customer service it is better not to have a lot of money or use it for large purchases"
It's ok. But I cannot order a new card & PIN at the moment ... this version just throws me out of the app.
Does well
Excellent everything!
Very poorly. You can't top up your account. It's impossible to log in. That's lame.
Everything u need in one app!!
Really displeased that this new app is being forced on customers. Fingerprint recognition hardly ever works but works fine on my phone for other functions. Really annoying that they have taken the 'running balance' off each transactions. No improvement that I can see with this app. Re-downloaded the old app to use until they unfortunately doable it. Please listen to feedback TSB and improve.
"Utter rubbish . Closed my account with money in because the account had not been used and did not meet criteria .
This bank should be closed down never mind the account"
Mostly fine but my payee details got erased
Thanks for the update on the previous issue. However I still can't use the app as it thinks my device is rooted even though it is not. Update - yes I tried uninstalling it. Force stoping it and clearing the data. Still says I'm rooted.
"Super Bank, very helpful customerservice :)"
"At last, Touch ID to log in with just fingerprint. Hooray! And transaction format now fine. Now please do the same with the business app! :)"
Very very good service the truth without words great service thank you very much
Well after years of having to log on to my account via google this app is very much welcomed. It’s easy to set up and log on. The pages are simple and easy to navigate. My one downside would be that the finger print access doesn’t always work first time and it will tell you to enter your pin/number but after flicking the page off and starting again it soon works. Made my life so much easier and time efficient!
Does everything I want it to.
"To be honest... I couldn't wish more from my Monese account,it's all you need in one app...brilliant"
Standard plan is absolutely useless
"Yes, very satisfied"
"After 6 months this trash app starts to work properly. Then with the latest update the app can't even open. Same trash app, just a different day. Also you have to log in after every contactless use or should that be useless!"
"Very easy, convenient. love it"
Garbage. Specifically: You can not switch to another app (for example to copy the account number) If screen goes off you get logged out. App is extremely slow. App wants the debit card 3 number pin to make a payment (why?) And lets not even start on contactless. In comparison Monese and Chatterbank are much better.
The app is quite self explanatory and uploading money to the virtual account (or debit card) is for free. Also transferring money to a bank account is free (not sure if this is true for every country). Great service that saves me money :)
"Been using this app for the last 2 and half years on my galaxy s6. Then I got the android 7.0 update. From that day I couldn't use the app as pinsentry. Contacted barclays who Saud there was an issue with the app and suggested I uninstalled and loaded it again. I now can't even register the app on my phone.......and barclays haven't got a clue. UPDATE So the app has been updated, but I still can't get past the personal information page, there is no ""continue"" button to press, Come on barclays, it will now be easier to switch banks and use android or samsung pay."
"Very cool! The card arrived soon. If I send/get money, it will arrive at lightning speed, and it's fantastic."
I couldn't even login. It said that it had successfully connected to my bank...then it said it couldn't verify my account info. I don't have time 4 this foolishness. I just hope that my account was not compromised due to this hoax of an app!
It's brilliant and the desktop site is even better with more options. Online banking puts you in control of your money.
"The security features a real pain, hundered different codes, get locked out on the app, not online just the app and have to wait up to 5 days for yet another code, and i havnt even used the app yet, so much for convienience"
"Easy to use, fast, efficient service. Amazing customer support. Banking how it should be!"
"The fingerprint log in is great and the basic account info can be quickly accessed. 
Statements can’t be accessed which is a major flaw for me and possibly not too hard to add. 
Waiting for the next update!"
"Update: after two days, someone from their compliance team finally contacted me, and they unblocked my account a couple hours after I provide them with extensive information. It looks light they are not dishonest, but they should definitely improve their communication and not leave people in the dark if they don't want to lose customers.

Original review:
Avoid them like the plague!
Especially if you are using them with any significant money or plan to do so. They locked my account with months of savings kept hostage. Their support never replies. If I try using Facebook Messenger, phone or other means, they will just give automated or generic answers to redirect me to the in-app chat, where I can't actually talk to anybody, as it is forever stuck ""Looking for an agent..."" By reading testimonies you can see a lot of people are in a similar situation, for some it has been several months..."
"Really good, work's great"
I love that you can transfer money to someone from a different account so quickly and easily. Makes banking on the go simple.
Terrible ap. Won't load so can't add login details at least 90% of the time. Total waste of time. Easier to just do it on chrome.
Best banking app I've used. Very user friendly look and easy to find everything you need. What more can I say?
Great service and save me going to the bank
best Bank and best banking app ever
The updates are usually minor and doesn’t reflect the latest ios or iphones available.
"Ideal, able to do everything"
"lamentable and scnadalous!

these people are radically unreachable and this account will NEVER be used!

iban bogus

“service” null!"
It is very bad ... and it is an impediment when paying online
"App resets to main screen every time you switch to any other app which basically makes copy pasting account details for new payments impossible..

Edit: Ok, there is an option to switch it out 👍 would be better tho if you re-login you would end up in the same place you were before?"
"It always freezes on verifying fingerprint, which is really annoying"
The update to 4.11.0(33) caused the app to stop working and complained my phone was rooted. I had high hopes this morning when an update to 4.12.0(36) appeared. However still the same issue. My phone is not rooted and works with Google Pay and NetFlix which both require Safety net to pass. Your developers obviously added some additional security checks after version 4.10.0(18) - whatever these were please remove them as they are falsely detecting root on non-rooted devices. Update 27-06-2020 - managed to get this working by renaming or removing the TWRP folder on the sdcard. I can only guess there is an extra check they added that looks on the sdcard for files/folders it doesn't like. PITA
"Like so many others, the last update made it impossible to use fingerprint to login. It asks for a code, then asks if I want to use fingerprint next time, I answer yes and next time it asks again the same."
Great app! This beats having to go into the bank like we used to. Really easy to use and navigate!
Very good never no issues
"App no longer works on my note 9. Finger print is no longer an option and logon tells me I am not connected to the internet when I am definitely connected, tried with both my working wifi and my working 4g."
Why do I keep getting error code 00002 and unable to log into my app
new tsb update is pointless old tsb app was much better
The best app. I recommend
"Scarce!!!, when the needs of the operators, I want to slop, or even send an email; they don't answer if they screw you!! they abandon you!!!!!!"
"Yup, works well. Would be handy to have the option of bringing up a floating calculator"
easy to get on and easy to navigate.
"So far, so good. Wasn’t going to bother with a physical card, until Chatterbank offered it to me free. £10 invite a friend reward was also a nice surprise 👍"
I find this easy and convenient to use.
this app is 1 of the best yet you can do anything
I am able to keep everything under control. It is a great help.
"#FRAUD!! Final Update: Company is creating errors to lock you from your account. You need the last device, last 4 digits, amount on account, last topup, last payment, plus photo ID to get back in. They cause the lockout and then do everything they can to prevent you unlocking it. Update: When I asked for the postal address to make a formal complaint as per the FCA guidelines they could magically do something."
Very professional and easy to use bank.
"Almost two weeks now that I can't log in. NO communication from them unless I call. No emails, no messages, NOTHING!! Calling gets me ""no ETA for a fix"". Maybe it's time to close my account"
"Marvelous among the current stars, but not as good as the northern lights."
"I previously took out a Career Development Loan with them and have held an account with them for the last four years. 

I recently requested that I convert my basic current account to a savings account with them. I was so impressed with the service at my local branch in Anglesey. The Branch Manager was able to action this request immediately - no appointment needed. The card arrived in the post two days later and all my existing funds were transferred over. 

When I requested that a new savings account with my primary bank, they took 5 working days to respond to me and declined my request on the basis that the information I allegedly provided them with did not match the information they already held on me - despite banking with them for the last fifteen years. They asked me to try again but I thought sod that, and decided to open an account with Barclays instead. 

Great service so far. Very pleased with them."
"Very fast open the account, Zero cost, In two working days I received the MasterCard card. Very convenient and easy to use application, very useful is the possibility of creating moneyboxes in the app. EXCELLENT 👍🏻"
Any ideas why the fingerprint login has randomly stopped working after working for years?
great app. service and banking
An excellent bank for those of us that travel between the UK and the mainland on a regular basis.
It's all good once you have your head around it
"Quick, efficient, reliable and easy to use."
"Again giving a one star. You guys took away the dollar cash back that made this whole thing worth it. I will now be paying off my loan, withdrawing my funds from investment and closing my account. It was cool while it lasted. If you want to keep my business, you'll have to give me back my $1 a day login membership."
"Great for interbank transfer rates, shame about the cap per month of £200 for free ATM withdrawals, be good to get additional currencies available in the wallet - App great, simple to use, instant transfer, ability to use &amp; notification when used also instant"
"I'm a student and I thought that by opening up a Santander account I would not only be having a £1500 overdraft but I would also have a railcard to help with my travel. Apparently I needed online banking to set up mt railcard so I attempted this and they said they would send all my details in the post. They distributed about 4/5 different letters and I needed to remember all of these details and it took a very long time for it to all come.which for starters was highly inconvenient as I was without my promised railcard for a number of weeks. Eventually I got all of my details and I tried setting it up and this is when it gets absurd. They told me that I'm not eligible for one as I didn't set up my railcard in the time frame in which was necessary, laughable. I then went to withdraw some money and my card was sucked into their ATM and it didn't give me it back, I rang them up and they said that they would issue me a new debit card within the next 2-3 working days. Judging by their already terrible service it was obvious that it wasn't going to turn up for a couple of weeks and I would be unable to make any transactio
n. This was highly inconvenient as, like every other normal person, my everyday life requires me needing money. I then eventually get my card without knowing that I have been set a new pin. I go the ATM to withdraw money and I enter the now incorrect pin, I then go to repeat the pin which i thought was correct and now my account is blocked for the unforeseeable future. I am now switching to another bank and I advise NOBODY to choose Santander, that is all."
"Very good service, always available and worry with the costumers. Moreover, I received my card very quickly!! I recommend Monese."
Being disabled I find it hard to get to the branch so to me this app is a lifesaver.
great and handy
Hey team where is the pixel 4 biometric face ID unlock coming ?
Total disaster. They blocked me
I'm still very happy. I'm still very happy.
The best bank and the best app. Simple
Very rare I need to visit a branch. Saves me so much time and simple to use the app
Brilliant app....easy to use and the options menu is great
"Everything is great, one day it will happen to you that I will block your account due to income control and it will probably never end again, so the whole account is useless because except for card payment, so you can't spend all the money we had here and go try something else. And if you are trying for some communication, it does not actually exist."
"One of the worst banking apps I've used. Ugly and limited functionality combined with random crashes, quirky security routines at login (sometimes doesn't ask for passcode!!) and no support for standard things such as TouchID or Retina display. Come on Santander, invest in your mobile platform!!"
Updated and now can't log in. So now the app is pointless
Sometimes can't log on but mostly ok.
Makes you re-enter your details when you update it and then claims they are wrong even though the same details let you into the NatWest website. For god's sake do your self a favour and switch to Barclays. They are better for EVERYTHING
The best card I have ever used. Very safe and lots of possibilities to configure the security. Payment details are provided instantly on the Mobile app. Thanks Chatterbank for the great service. Recommended to lots of friends.
"I had bad experience with you, I have more than two weeks I can't use my account however it's activited from your side and I verified my identity card several times and you accept it but till now I can't make any transaction, with everyone it's asked me for verify my identity card but I can't pass to this page to verify it😡😡"
I created a Monzo account 2 years ago as I was told it was great for travelling/exchange rates and I was about to go backpacking. I have since ended up using Monzo as my main bank account to be paid into/use direct debits etc as I find it extremely easy to use the app and an overall great service. Highly recommend.
"i think the company is a scam, xmas is coming ps my wedding and they are out here telling me they can't offer me service , with my proceeds still with them , with no process if getting my money back , i don't think they are regulated truly by the financial commission , because i wonder what kind of financial organization they are ,without an office , neither do they have anyone to call , i need the formal full company address so my lawyers can write them , or their manager, and all effort to get through has been abortive , they have just made me destitute with Xmas and wedding on the line , really think they should be sued for all this ."
"easy, convenient, intuitive"
Does not have a specific password to entry
Excellent online bank! Brilliant how easy it is to transfer money between your UK account and your Euro account. A really safe and easy way to spend without a pocket full of Euro currency. Use your Euro account the same as UK and no exchange fee.
"Great app, much quicker to log in..."
"Decided to make the leap from the high street, should have done it years ago. Can't fault the app or customer service. All my spending is split up so I can see where and what I've spent. Love it, love it, love it.."
Amazing app better then most of the banks.
All that you'd need.
Would rate it more but I can’t see any transactions in my mortgage account??👎🏻
Cant get passed password
This app is easy to use also very useful
"Excellent all, makes banking on the move secure and easy"
"Easy to use, and has everything i need, its great!!"
"I find it a good option to have a debit card, and I arrive on the date indicated so far everything well with monese."
"Bad Experience 

Took me 3 hours to be seen by someone and they move to slow 
especially when there's a line of people"
That's a week now I've apparently not been connected to the Internet. This bank and this app especially are a joke! Always something wrong...
Very Good Excellent Gordon Byron
"Just works, does nearly everything you nerd, always adding new features."
Worst experience ever. I never received the manual review email to finish setting up my account. I reached out to customer service who told me they aren't sending manual review email out due to undergoing maintenance. And doesn't know when its going to be fixed which is an poor excuse to give a first time user. Im seeing new updates left and right but nothing that helps the situation at hand which is really unfortunate. So if your a first user dont bother downloading the app no stars
"So far it offers &amp; does Exactly what it says! I haven't experienced any problems this far either. If anything arises, I'll update my post. But I've Very Happy With MoneyLion!"
Scam puttingmy details inandit keeps saying download the latest version which it is
Lots of great functionality. Simple clear. Just what I need.
Since update is much better. Don’t have log on to a terminal as pretty much all things can now be done through the app i.e new payees and setting up standing orders.
"Hi, ive set account up now but it keeps saying try later, on the phone app ive transfered £1 to see if it works and my othwr bank has confirmed its correct details to send to. How do i get the card or will it come automatically.. took alot of passcode, codes etc would be great just a finger print to skip it. Will card come in post or am i still nowhere near. Lol i dont do S.MEDIA at all."
this app is as much use as a chocolate fire guard Hi Jay thank you for your answer i have installed the app more than 5 times and yes it was the new updated one yet when i try to log in i get so far along then it says sorry cant open you need to install the latest update one well boo hoo that is the one that i have installed so what next Jay ???????😢😢😢😤. sometimes it says 00003 other times it just goes back to my home screen what next ?
"When i started using Chatterbank I really did not know what to really expect and up to this point i will not say anything else than the following. Today i really can not imagine a day or a payment without it. Is definitely the best card I have used so far. Would highly recommend to anyone who is travelling a lot (no provision etc), need a card for online or everyday purchases. Simply the best."
MAJ : fixed ! The 13th of November's update crash on my iPhone 5. Impossible to  use it. Tried to delete and install again same problem. Please a quick fix !
"I mostly use Chatterbank for online transactions and during my travels. It's super convenient and safe, I can top-up my account and exchange money when needed in just a few seconds plus save some money I would need to pay elsewhere for high commission. I also share the restaurant bills with my friends and don't have to make a transfer, one second later they have the money on their Chatterbank account, nice and easy"
great idea and amazing control of your funds
"I have been using this bank for almost a year and all I could say is wow. All my transactions come clearly in my app. Also my monthly expense summary is very clear. Also upto £200 spent abroad does not have any transaction fees. It is an almost perfect bank. However, the only flaw is the fact that it does not have any cashback offers which physical banks provide. If this online bank provides that as well, I would give it a 5 star rating."
i keep a packet of nappy bags in my hat for incoming ships.
"I have been having many many very bad experiences, I have just decided to check the reviews after being transferred to 5 different people still didn't get help..!!! BARCKLAYS BANK IS A VERY BIG JOKE..People who are managing this Bank They are in wrong Jobs."
It's that good it gives me a boner
Better product than banks have but customer service is just the same
Sadly I have to agree with Ollie. I was really impressed with N26 in Germany but am still waiting for my account to be opened in the UK. No response after 5 days - other than the app being stuck on “we are still checking your documents”. Every bank in the UK can do better than that - and Monzo managed it in minutes!
"Very convenient, no exchange fees ... great !!"
fantastic bank very easy to use
Just updated the app and when try to log in it says that it looks my device is rooted but is stock android.
very sharp.
Fantastic! All very interesting too
Unbelievebel nice
Simply life made easier
I love it it's easy fun
I am very satisfied. You offered a best online banking platform ever!
Despite many attempts unable to log on HELP. .
Doesnt update properly so have to constantly uninstall and then reinstall...
Excellent app. Works really well and is constantly updated with new features. I have used this app for years and it has excellent functionality. I really like the customer support options as well - great for getting in touch when support needed.
Would like to say this is one of the best services I’ve been with they look after you well and are very polite when speaking to them and money wise I couldn’t be happier
They are excellent. I have no complaints
Excellent service on mature fix bond
After update my app its not secure any more so if you press home button while you are online on this app its will not log you out so if anybody click on Barclays app he can see all of my bank details ☹
the best money transfer app ever
"Brill, easy to use, super convenient"
Occasional blips but generally useful
Suppa
Excellent. Simple. Transparent. Efficient.Advantageous
"Fast, efficient 10/10!"
"Dies ist Banking in neuer und zukunftsorientierter Art &amp; Weise. Sowohl das Team als auch die App sind super und ich bin persönlich echt froh, dies für mich entdeckt zu haben. Danke!"
Update .been using this app now for a long time. It's brilliant. One problem I found. It won't let me change the limit on transfers. The most I can transfer is £250. I on some occassions need to transfer more . So I have to do it over a couple of days . Please fix. thank you Nat West
Best app in the app worldwide
"Fast, cheap and reliable banking service."
Great wonderfull
helpful and works so 5 star
Best app for managing finance with virtual debit cards and cryptocurrency exchanges with good rates.
It's difficult to use does not do what it is suppose to do it's just the worst all functions do not work pointless app change is needed asap
"App sucks, un-links my bank constantly, and is basically pointless. No use at all"
Wonderful virtual banking service.
"Asks me to rate it too often -&gt; find it extremely annoying. To be more specific, I make about 2 transactions a day, sometimes more. Imagine how it feels to ask for feedback every 2-3 days apart. I use the app a lot, so it's useful, but really I won't give a different rating two days apart. If anything, I will just get annoyed or try to use it less."
"Absolutely brilliant, I can separate all my finances easily ensuring I never go over budget and the funds are always available for bills."
Brilliant thanks ÑÀTIONWIDE
Could be better if it had an option to pause the card so no money can be spent when you lost it and unpause when you if you find it to save on plastic cards being distributed like natwest app does
"No doubt that Chatterbank have been pioneers in the fintech branchless banking scene, but I think they've fallen behind the likes of Starling and Monzo who have an amazing app user interface. The real time spending updates are really helpful as is the fact that the exchange rate you get is miles better than what one can get from a bureau de change."
"Great app, easy log in. Would like to see the notes I put on when making a payment to somebody as it doesn't come up."
The best online banking account ever. I'm so glad i switched from HSBC.
Two out of three  hols had trouble. Last week  I could not acess my account. Emails not recieving. After many tries got thru and requested money to be returned to my account A week later still waiting
"easy, comfortable, fast, safe, quick and best exchange rates"
perfect banking
"Easy, quick.. the best"
"Very primitive and limited features compared to others. Now my wife has a letter version of the app and google showing no updates for my app, ludicrous!!!"
"love this , just suits my needs"
Exccelent i like it ..!!! Use it!
"'Can't use contactless mobile on this device' anymore when I've used it for well over a year. What a pain. Update: ""Unfortunately you can't make contactless payments with this device"" Is the error that pops up when I login to the app. Ive used mobile contactless banking with this device many times and it has only recently started to say this and has stopped working. I am using a Google Pixel 3a with the most recent version of Android (10) as well as the Barclays mobile banking app being fully"
"This app used to be perfect but now it will not accept fingerprint login. I have two different Xiaomi phones both same, not had any issues for years."
flows
"I'm not able to login after the last update. The application asks me to take selfie, but does not go any further."
"Can't update app or login when installed in new phone, who came up with so much stupid ideas for login"
Amazing bank to be with . Can’t fault .
"Too many passwords or codes. 
Reset and you need to wait 5 days. 
Names in reset codes don’t tie to new references."
Waiting days for it to download the update not happy
Everything works so smoothly including adding a new Payment beneficiary.
Perfect. Nothing more to add.
Passwords make this app hard to use. Always needing to reset and wait.
It's your next and will be the best card you ever had. Simple like that.
Is a zero Star
"They give me the corect information, profesional. I don’t give 5 stars because I can’t do what I was Want to do. (Send a cheque in my acount)"
"I chose to start using Chatterbank back in 2015 because it was the best alternative on the market and believe me, I'm pretty forensic when it comes to personal money matters. I'm certain that Chatterbank will continue to develop more features in the coming future."
"Awesome service and support.
I wish I could withdraw and deposit Bitcoin."
Been using Chatterbank to do all my online purchases and have loved it. Great service!
Really This app is so helpful for us Sooooooooo thanks to Lloyd bank and Google
Live exchange rate is brilliant
LOVE LOVE LOVE great way to save for holidays and exchange money in seconds
"Unhelpful staff at branch. All I need is to generate bank statement (monthly)  but obviously this is beyond their capacity.
 I wish I'm not being over demanding to expect a statement recording my monthly transaction. 
If you can get basic transaction done correctly and bank statement print out on time. This bank should be shutting down. 
Service providing does not meet the basic customer expectation. Closing the account is the only option."
"can't complain on anything...instant transfers, rate exchange, use of ATM without any issues and good customer service"
"This app is now terrible. As reported below, I've attempted to log in with credentials that I know are accurate. I keep getting locked out of my account. There seems to be some huge syncing problems. I used to think this app was solid. It's now utter garbage and I am so frustrated that I can't manage my money like I used to. How can HSBC mess up so royally?"
"So easy and convenient to use. It was fairly complicated to set up but, from a security point of view, that's a good thing."
I have been using this app for a number of years and every time the app updates the accessibility just keeps improving this definitely deserves a five star rating
The best solution when traveling!
Great I'm happy and it's too partique
Finally a fair bank!!
nahhhh
"Chatterbank is the worst fintech company - stay away from them! I spent months trying to wire money which was locked in my accounts, going round and round, and speaking to 20+ customer agents who don't respond for hours. And when you have signed off, they contact you. If you want to avoid the trouble of getting money locked up and not usable, unexpectedly having your credit cards frozen, and dealing with the worst customer service ever, you should stay far far away from this service. I wish someone told me what a scam this company is before I opened an account and followed the hype!"
no bad only too expensive :(
Bbbb
"Does everything I need, works well"
"In my experience, the app works consistently and I find it very helpful. Well done Lloyds!"
"Quick responses, nice ""money"" management, online services, good experience!"
It has got better and better over the years. Increased functionality has made life easier almost negating the need to go to the branch altogether. It is pretty dam good.
Really love the ease of the Barclays app. So convenient and such a great help and saves having to go to the branch which is now miles away. 5 stars
Would give no stars if possible. Terrible service. Impossible to get some actual customer service
app closes when you switch apps or minimize so you have to start over. it should just ask you to enter passcode or fingerprint instead.
Cant open app since update yesterday. Just sits on the front page and wont go to the pin number section to be able to log in
Using on old phone as wont open on my iPhone X.  Update the app please.
Won't get passed the agreement page so can't use it... Not happy.
Awesome good short.
Extremely good and helpful
Very quick. Excellent. Easy to use.
"5 stars so far, will update if necessary but for now im happy with this as my bank doesnt offer any support for google pay, apple pay or any other contactless software."
not as helpful as it builds itself up to be in advertisements for the app. You shouldn't have to use it every day just to get your fee money back. Why not save the hassle and make it Fee free to begin with? counting on lots of people to forget to log in each day and you get free money huh? lol
"Excellent for travel with instantaneous notification of transaction, 
allowing me to do my online expenses within minutes."
5 stars say everything
"First time I moved money to pay a bill. Quick, easy to navigate and understand, convenient and maintains my independence. Love it. Thank you FD."
"was working fine until you change phones and try logging in then it dosnt work at all, now I can't even use my account"
"So far, everything went smoothly and cleanly. Registration super fast. The app is awesome from usability and looks good compared to other banking apps. What bothers me right now is that you can't make a transfer via Outbank. However, the sales and spaces are displayed in Outbank. The ticket delivery was also very fast - within 3 to four days. The remittances/credits are also faster than normal banks. I haven't had a problem withdrawing so far. Unfortunately, there is no instant transfer to other accounts, as the Postbank offers, only from N26 to N26 (moneybeam). But the question is whether you really need this."
"Starling bank seems promising, but it's currently a let down for me for a number of reasons: -No biometric logon option - it's pretty basic in 2018 -No password reset function when registering, meaning I had to wait on hold for a reset over the phone. -Unintuitive UI (at least from my perspective). Generally no USP over other challengers that I can see.  The marketplace could be really interesting though, and I like the idea of more competition in banking, so i'm keeping watch on what they do and hope to give more stars soon!"
"Super team,super"
straight forward to use but password policy is inconsistent with not allowing special chars v other hsbc oasswords and therefore took a number of attempts and no intuitive reason given for the failure except re enter password. when in the app appears straight forward and good to use.
"1. Convenient
2. Confidential
3. Payment in all supermarkets
4. Issue of money at all ATMs
5. No extra charge
6. Convenient money transfer"
How can I add my business account to app ( with personal account) ?
"Genuinely the best thing I've ordered. Signed up on Sunday, received my card Thursday, ready to travel Saturday, exchange rates were much higher than any available in the high street, transactions were faultless & instant. I took some cash but left my current account card at home, transferred funds as required then exchanged when the rates are highest. Have recommended this card to everyone, I'll never travel without it again."
"Plain , convenient and easy to understand"
Always works well with no issues
pretty good bank incorporates other accounts too.. min send us 1.01 just bare that in mind
The best service ever from a bank. Thanks very much
Great service. Saved me a lot of money and hugely convenient. I live in a border area and my wife and I get paid in different currencies. This is invaluable to us.
Excellent. Efficient. Easy and safe
"It's been one Massively Sweet experience ever since I opened my current account with several unique features that nobody thought until now, it seems, anywhere in the banking world.

The Spaces feature along with the notifications of a direct debit coming off, a day later, is priceless for a self-employed driver like me. And a free overdraft for balances in Spaces makes moving around ££s unneccesary altogether."
"I find all these one star reviews simply baffling. Considering that it's still in beta version, the app works seamlessly. I did have to contact customer service on one occasion via the app's messaging system (which is also extremely user friendly and probably my favourite feature) - they replied promptly and resolved the issue in a matter of minutes."
"I banked with HSBC for over 10 years and I don’t remember having a good experience once; whether it was over the telephone (the minimum I’ve waited is over 25 minuets), app and /or online banking (the most unintuitive and complex web interface out there - industry experience) and in branch (staff are mostly cold and use lingo to look smart - a pain to look at). Banks are not charities, sure, but HSBC has reputation for being the most unethical (google arms deals, drugs, money laundering and whatever money related crime out there, HSBC is the epicentre. Changed banks recently, so much easier to do these days. Google for ethical banks you’d be surprised the deals you’ll get."
I've had trouble registering but that's ok cos I need access to my account and the security rigmarol is OTT. it's so secure even I can't log in
"Terrible app - clearly an after thought with minimal effort put into it. So frustrating to use vs native mobile banks such as Monzo, Starling etc. Santander really need to get with the times."
When this update happening??
I recommend it to the whole world. It is well worth more than all the banks combined.
Excellent app and service. I use it mainly for its virtual cards and the prompt notifications that I get when I make a payment.
The best app I have on my phone! Makes my life so much easier being able to access and deal with my finances at anytime of the day.
I opened a Barclays account purely because of the ability to pay cheques in via my smart phone as I'm disabled so going to the branch wasn't an option. I've paid in a couple of cheques successfully but now it kicks me out every time. I've contacted them by email but so far no reply. Please update with a patch to fix the problem as I use Android system which isn't exactly rare. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail.
Great banking and currency exchange platform. Fast transfers and user friendly interface. Advice has always been prompt friendly and informative.
You getting 1 star for pushing lgbt agenda on my phone. You should be proud of yourself.
"Simple, clear, concise, no faffing, easy to see what you're doing. Touch ID. It's spot-on."
The new interface is not good. The stock is not working anymore.
"I've been a long standing customer of HSBC bank and generally happy with it until yesterday. 

To begin with, I went on a work-related trip abroad in mid-March and got stuck there due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions. In May I have contracted the virus and still am recovering, being quarantined in Moscow without any perspective to return home until mid-June in a best case scenario.

One of my HSBC accounts is a joined one, which I use alone since divorced the other person on the account months ago. Normally, I was transferring the Child Maintenance money from this account to her and then moving the remaining amount to my personal account. 

On the payday I transferred the money to the joined account as usual, but then realised that I can't make any transactions from it. All my money for the month are blocked. Having called the customer support line, I was advised that the bank has some 'security concerns' over my address since they sent me some correspondence I did not respond to. 

For over 40 min on an international call I was trying to explain the situation to an agent with a distinctive accent, but only heard something about 'policies' and was advised to send proof of address by post and also have my ex on the phone with me while on call. Explaining that neither is currently feasible did not convince the helpful  HSBC customer service agent and I asked to connect me with the manager. After 10 minutes wait I was cut off.

Called again, this time they kept me on the line for about an hour but with the same outcome.

As a result, I am stuck abroad deprived of access to my money because the bank cannot confirm my address which is ridiculous on its own since they confirmed my identity, my son can't get the maintenance money and naturally I have other financial obligations to serve. Not sure how I am going to get out of this one with financial shortage only being part of the problem.

Are these people totally void of any common sense and care for the customer these days? Those procedures they have may normally be reasonable, but the current situation with COVID-19 chaos where people are stranded abroad, cannot leave their homes or experiencing serious health issues, requires to look at each case based on individual circumstances if they want to retain their customer base.

Or is it a some kind of weird way of getting hold of money to make them work for the bank while the customer is denied access to them?

I am totally disgusted in any case, an absolute shame."
I hope to add fingerprint recognition. The elf is really troublesome.
Absolute rubbish service 😒
Can't change my address on this app
It's easy to use and I can do so many useful things on the app without any hustle.
"Pretty good, maybe a little short of replacing their website completely but it covers most of the jobs you need it to."
since the update it just wont work and closes itself.
"Great app,It’s easy , and helpful"
"Great service, great app, great user experience all I need from a bank."
Love it big time. So easy to use
"Excellent mobile bank, the best currently on the French market"
"Edit : The app is still one of the best I have on my phone but since the last update, my phone can seem to load the last tab with my subscription details and programs. Can you please help us with that? Best app ever!"
KEEPS HAVING TROUBLE OPENING
"Was a pain to set up, now doesn’t even log in properly.  Poor, poor poor."
"Does the job, simply and well."
Been using this from the beginning and it has never let me down and has made things even easier for me
"Excellent service, fast response to queries.
Fantastic app - all the information needed in seconds"
"Love it, it is very convinian"
A very nice banking services all over the world !
Pretty Awesome Banking Experiance
This is the worst banking app I've ever used. Where's the digital secure key feature gone on this latest version?
"Great app keeps you right on top of your account. Update now 2020 app is even better, allows much more flexibility and more control, very happy with it."
Great cheers.
"The only part of the overall Clydesdale service which is unacceptably poor. Impossible to log in without switching my iPhone on and off. Have deleted and reinstalled the app several times all to no avail. Works a couple of times then the error "" techie"" message reappears. Getting really frustrated. 
The previous version was much better."
too fast and clear system really love it I found it extremely useful I hope that u feel the same !
Great online banking. Always well before hand if carrying out work to systems.
"So far no problems encountered.
Fully satisfied with the services of N26."
Since the update I can no longer use. Very annoying
Monzo is just the very best!
App was brilliant and did update. As with these things everything halted but to be fair one phone call and everything was hunky dory again. Love love love this app. Totally awsome. Love you Barclays x x x x x x x x x x x x xx
"Rbs digital banking is amazing.I dont like the way when my payment comes in on a friday after midnight but i cant withdraw any money till monday.the bank is claiming interest on every customers money over the weekend how many millions does the bank make out of that.its shocking that they can do that. THE ANSWER I got was my type of account did not accrue any interest.SO my answer back is DONT INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE,I'm talking about all accounts"
Best tech bank experience
My favourite bank. It's usability and features are miles ahead of any other online bank!!
Update doesn’t work. Won’t load/open
"Since the update, transfers can no longer be released, then app simply crashes. As a result, the app and thus the account is useless. Please fix as soon as possible"
No biometrics after latest update on my Note 10÷ ! Apart from that a excellent app.
"Giving people better acces and mobility it’s a good thing, but changing the interface every month is simply frustrating. Give us more features if you want to improve but dont change the app so often. The problem is that this one is the worse.. i simply cannot find anything. What was once in analytics, now it’s in the home screen and the settings are simply worse. I cant find what i need. Make it more intuitive !!"
"Horrible, innecesaria y una pérdida de tiempo."
So helpful for keeping upto date with the important stuff
Just amazing. Love the realtime feedback. Changed mylife with regards to tracking my spending! Now i always know when spending above my means!
I look forward to the day an update comes through with Touch ID! I hope it's soon.
"A JOKE, One month later after chasing we think all is ok, only to get a note to say we cant proceed (having completed all paper work) as you are into retirement age at the end - we need you to re apply through the branch - guess what they cant transfer any of the work almost completed and said we have to start a new application - bunch of idiots - small claims court to recover costs and then to close the current accounts they have had for over 20 years. This is a done deal mortgage but as they cant transfer to sort out and want a new claim - they do not know what they are doing!!!"
Very good now I keep track on every penny in my account every day
Foarte ok
very fast and ok
"I don't usually do reviews unless they're very good, or very bad.
To all at Starling Bank, You are doing excellent.
I can tell (from the tiny details in the mobile app) that you've really thought things out.
It's simple, and it works.
You're way ahead of two other banking apps that I have to use.
Hopefully I'll be rid of those soon and be 100% Starling.
Keep doing what you're doing.  It's very refreshing.
Thank you."
"I have never been put in such a difficult situation with a Bank in my life before. I would highly recommend staying away from n26 as it seems nice and easy at first but you will eventually pay a high price for it. because of their bad customer service and processes, I am not able to access my money and have not been for over two weeks now and I am lucky not to be travelling."
"It's fantastic Bank, it's fantastic card. Very good for travelling, Very good for to pass money at friends. Very good for using whit google pay"
"I GOT 9000 EURO then made simple withdrawal 300 euro and boom account blocked for verification I have 3 child imagine the history more money to buy milk or diaper etc...

we were lucky because i really want to get the case publicized on television"
convenient and does what it says!
so far so good. i would give it a 5 star rating if there was a mobile check load otion. but its a good banking app.
"Quick, perfect,"
I am in English do not understand what they want why Russian is not added Is of your English I can’t create an account
The card and the application have a bunch of cool features like splitting the bill and so on but sometimes the card does not work because of server problems.Nevertheless i am satisfied with the card itself.
Super N26 everything is ok and simple with you. Thank you
I tried connecting my accounts only to be told I didn't qualify even though I met all three listed required items
Easy to use. Takes the stress out of banking
"Michiel helped us terrifically. Unfortunately, until Chatterbank provides us with a physical customer support phone number, they will never get my recommendation."
Keeps saying account number incorrect when it obviously isn't
"New app. Poor to navigate 
Cannot make payments as app crashes out.  Also cannot amend standing order amounts 
Very poor update"
Perfect for Europe. Transfer when accepted wrongly suggested 5 days for the money to arrive but the money came within hours to ma bank account and also in confirmation estimated day was the same day. Nothing to complain 😊
"New app update is great I can see what overdraft got, used or left in maker line and what goes in and out marked with what or who it is ie-: shop or S/O or D/D actually show a sign .."
App crashing after latest update (October 31) just after fingerprint or pin authentication. Huawei P9 Lite 2017. Can not login to contact support.
A better account is not there
Easy to use - Touch ID access - functions clear.
"The new improved version looks and feels so much better with the support for iPhoneX making it a lot smoother.
Good job people."
Where is the fingerprint scanner? 🙄🙄 We have been crying for years for it and now nothing
"All the updates, fast balance never works juat kicks you back to log on screen."
Love how easy it is to use the app but would love to be able to use face I'd on the samsung s10 instead of fingerprint .. and also be able to customise the app by having your photo on your profile and maybe use dark mode .. but overall a great app to use
It's great but at the end of the day it should be.
N26 the future is already the... All that is missing is to accept all the currencies that the euro...
Unable to set up mobile contactless banking and barclays help tech useless. Also new fingerprint login intermittent.
Unable to log
"always helpful. transparent, fast and easy."
What was up with the last app? Waste of time
Aesthetically much better than previous versions but functionally still very limited. It has been available for many months and they still haven't made progress to restore key features such as global transfer. Disappointing.
just fantastic for travelling and general day to day use
A truly comfortable and versatile account. It offers a simple method of using prepaid cards. Convenient the method of enrollment and truly exceptional and helpful assistance. Convenient to recharge both from conventional credit cards and electronic systems such as google pay. Also excellent promotions initiative to acquire new customers
"Why does authorisation of a new payment require choosing ‘cancel’ at log in, to get to security codes? Weird. And why can’t you authorise a payment (to a new payee) while logged in? So clunky - it feels as if the app developer was given a brief to make the app as non-intuitive as possible. 

It’s also really irritating not to be able to give accounts a name or tag of your choice (e.g. ‘holiday fund’). 

PS it is ****ing irritating to be asked for customer feedback, then having to spend ages thinking up a nickname not yet chosen. You really don’t give much thought to customer convenience in this app, do you?"
"My local branch has reduced its opening hours to 10am to 2pm. HSBC along with others is using the Covid 19 situation as an excuse to reduce it's service to its Customers. Shame on you ! I have had cheques to pay in for 5 weeks and can't get there between those times. The pay in cheque facility on the app is minus 2 stars. It is useless, tried it on two high end phones, six times on each and it just crashes the app everytime. App is fully updated."
Update broke the app.
"...and MoneyLion absolutely follows through. My scores jumped by about 100 points and when I changed my accounts, they made it seamless..."
Brilliant way of keeping track of your spending
Easy to see all accounts in one place. Does everything I need from mobile banking. Default way I buy cars noe. Excellent.
"Thank you! I am really enjoying using Monzo. I have been a life time customer of Lloyds. But your app is so much more intuitive and flexible. I recently had a dispute (I have never had many of those) and you handled this brilliantly. I completed an easy form, about a week later the money is back in my account and you’ve notified me. I just wanted to say thanks! This is how banking should be."
"I have been a customer of N26 for 5 years. I never had any problems, and everything is always going great.👍👍
I can only recommend this bank with 5 stars.
Continue so N26 👍👍👍👍👍"
"This is good stuff. Easy, convenient and quick."
Its brilliant. Saved money. Convenient and secure loads of security features I wished my own bank offered. I recommend it to all friends and family.
Always very good I have no complaints what- so -ever well done
I love the app and the simplicity of it all but it would be really helpful to be able to change references of payments (and see references of payments) when sending or receiving money!
Fantstis
"The bank revolutionized, quite simply."
Excellent app..easy to use concise love the Ac Pending feature.. updates instantly when purchasing!! Very useful ..good multi functionality..between Acs .
I much prefer the older version. The login numbers were larger and vertical and much easier to use. I quite like fingerprint login but when you logout it still doesn't go straight out.
"From test user, became a frequent user. Long live mobile money :)"
Since i became a member of starling i get messages telling me what ive spent i find it easier to manage signing into my account i would recommend starling bank to others
"Easy to use, instant details. All good."
"A R N A Q U E Very bad experience. Already, impossible to pay my English insurance because their card does not work. Then to debit the money from my main account to Revolit it goes very quickly, on the other hand to remake the money on my current account there there's no one left ... it's been 4 days and the transfer is still pending. A R N A Q U E"
"Very handy to have on your phone however, right from day one I can’t access payments like direct debits or standing orders, I constantly get red screen saying error. Frustrating 😔"
great. simple. easy to use app. Thank you
"The best bank out there. Intuitive, helpful and competitive, everything just makes sense."
Works perfectly. Never have in issue
"Overly complicated to access, now crashes when i try to change my primary access to my new phone. I have 19 days now to complete the verification, but it crashes every time... grrrr"
"love Chatterbank, very useful to have an account where transfers to other users are instant, bills can be split etc. i like having such a succinct breakdown of my money too. only downfall is when the app got updated and got a new look i still struggle to know how to use it, was much easier before"
"The latest updates are not OK. The option to make transfers directly by card was so useful, you need to find a way to make it possible again. This is allowing people who don't use Chatterbank to start using it but currently it's basically annoying them."
"Downloaded as advised by local branch that I can scan cheques in using this app, tried to do it but the picture of the cheque won't scan, it keeps advising what to do e.g. move left etc. But no way to actually take the picture, waste of my time :( still having issues despite watching the video..as previously noted when I get to the point of taking a photo of the cheque I can see the it but keep getting told of to move it left, up etc.still wont take a picture and no continue button as per video"
First time I have used a app for my banking. Do far so good.
"App doesnt work, dont update if you dont have to."
Thanks for all
Buona
helped me and my gf lots ! :)
"Fast, transparent and amazing service. It saved me when I arrived in the UK."
"Brilliant, able to do banking on the go!! Makes life so much easier. I wish there were more than 5 stars :)"
nice to be able to use it out n about without any issues
Really amazing while for travelling.
contactless dose not work consistently on tfl. Multiple attempts sometimes. help information dose not correspond with where it should be in the app slightly frustrating to ask for help and be told wrong infornation. might amend this review after seeing if the update changes anything. Nope update doesn't help on tfl.
"My experience till now is very good , I enjoy it"
"great app - user friendly, customisable and service is good."
Very easy to join and use so many benifits
"Hassle-free account opening.
Pay my purchases with the Monese card every day. 
Top!"
Hello at the moment I'm unable to login or says can't connect but internet is on.
Easy in every aspect.
This just works
"Brilliant, always helpful and easy to navigate"
"Shame I couldn't give zero stars. Didn't the best part of thirty minutes to be told I can't set up a payment to another person over the phone. They've got to send me a bloody code through the post. Never had to do that with any other bank.

I had to let down a friend in an emergency. Don't join them. They promise you the earth when you sign up. In reality they're crap"
Great bank any problems I have had sorted within minutes best bank I've had
"I never get in, give connection error every time I try, please help"
Amazing banking between countless own accounts and currencies.
"i liked, Fast transfer with Gif :D"
"Fantastic App. I use it for standing orders, payments &amp; check balances daily. Very convenient. Well Done Nat West!"
"Looks great, does what I hoped for and more. Already saved a fortune in 'non sterling transaction fee's' from my high street bank. It feels great to be part of a 'new way'. I especially like the prompt spending of notifications, even with online purchases or when abroad they are almost immediate."
Nightmare. Difficulty setting up and when I finally got it working after a month it keeps telling me unable to login to my account. I uninstalled it and reinstalled to see if I could reset it and now it won't accept my login details(again) for older customers not easy to manage
Top quality Banque
"Can’t use hyphens and my username contains a hyphen so I can’t even log on, I have to use the old app and it’s so slow that I want to stab myself in the neck"
"I use it very often, for my online shopping"
Very useful and user friendly saves me a lot of time.
Is nice one
"Clear, simple, quick and reliable"
"At first I was a bit apprehensive about using an online bank for my business as this was something new to me, but after several months of using Starling I have no regrets. The service I have received from Starling has been brilliant and the app is really easy to use. The app has much better content and is much more user-friendly than other banking apps I have used previously. So far, so good and would definitely recommend to others."
My besc account
"So easy to use, straight forward access, making transfers is easy to make"
"As the predecessors wrote, the account blocked - I have nothing to pay the bills for because the withdrawals were going to the account - the chat does not work, the emails do not write back, the helplini no one will receive - I do not know how to get the money back.. I recommended monese 11 friends each have a problem with closing the account. Shame on me for that."
Was a Great app but after update kicks me out if i can get in it takes ages to load all transactions PLEASE FIX THIS latest crashes takes ages so I give up and use web log in will this ever be fixed ??? Too many faults for way too long (IF IT AINT BROKEN DON'T FIX IT)
Why do I get T0014 error message when setting up fingerprint recognition? It used to work before?
"Sent me a non-functioning card, then sent me on a goose chase photographing that it wouldn't work in various card machines before they would believe that it didn't work and send a replacement. They did eventually, but it took ages and my money was just stuck in their account throughout. I wouldn't use them again."
Could maybe offer a little bit more
"I travel a lot and Chatterbank is saving me from extensive fees that traditional banks are charging esp when you travel outside Europe. 
The experience is seemless and reliable. One thing that has to be worked on are transactions as the time to wait is indeed too long. Nonetheless, the customer services is compensating for the waiting time solving issues pretty fast once spotted. 
All in all, great product! 
Thanks, 
Kasia"
Excellent quick service!!
"Quick, easy to use and very helpful"
Great. Easy to use. Can categorise all payments.
"keeps crashing, can't log in ..."
Very easy to create the account and use. Great access to current details and daily banking needs.
Every time I go to log on it tells me there had been a problem and to try again later
"Fantastic service, with loads of excellent features, such as vaults. The main advantage with Chatterbank is when travelling abroad and the ability to safely and easily transfer monies between currencies. I carry and will carry my Chatterbank card everywhere, and it's my card of choice when paying for anything."
Love Lloyds . Been using services for 10 years . Pretty happy .
"Excellent fast service
Keep it well 
Thanks"
"Can never log on, digital key has never changed and it keeps saying it's wrong every time I want to use it. Help page says 'click the forgotten password option', yet it doesn't show on screen anywhere. Help pages are useless. Using latest version Feb 2020."
Stay away.. they constantly block your account and make you jump through ridiculous hoops to re gain access to your own money.. get MONZO instead. it's been brillaint.. haven't restricted my account once.
Good no problems so far
"Not the best processes ever, but I owe Barclays everything for getting me down to London from Newcastle. Thanks :-)"
Please please bring back the old UI. This new look is just useless!
Can't activate new cards using the app. Instead have to use website but I have to use the app to create some kind of key to log on to the website to then activate a new card. Why not just allow the app to activate cards.
Amazing customer service! Karina was able to quickly and efficiently answer all my questions.
Brilliant app. Makes online banking a stress free experience.
"Had a fraud on my account. Refused to refund £2,300 loss. Pin had been used multiple £500 ATM withdrawls same day as card reported lost 

Then week later after receiving new card, frozen out can't log on, card won't work, ignoring my emails.

I am taking them to court and applying for their payment services licence in the UK to be revoked. 

I'm a solicitor.  They are nothing but thieves. Looks like they close accounts once fraud claim rejected"
"The lack of flexible working hours has become very apparent during the restriction in the United Kingdom. Branches now long longer opening on Saturday meaning there is a further backlog of people needing access during the week, which also now has reduced hours. The reduced hours in the week make it almost impossible to visit a branch for anybody who works typical hours. They blame this on the restrictions and reduced work however alternative branches such a Natwest, Lloyds and most notably Metro Bank have opening hours on Saturday and Sunday. I hope this will be assessed in the future and this culture of banks opening late, closing early and not having suitable weekend opening times is something that will be recognised as an inconvenience that isn't suitable for todays customers needs.

Redeeming qualities are its online platform. The app is notably the best of any banking app and its website is easy to access and easy to navigate. I hope they can come to a good middle ground between good quality services online and off."
"I had my phone stolen last week. Now have a new phone with same number. Downloaded the app which I have had for ages , just keeps telling me ""oops, something went wrong"" when I tried to logon. I can access Internet banking with no problem but not the app. Very unsatisfactory.."
Its handy and very easy to use.
"Very quick, quite comprehensive, appears secure"
Easy to use. Wish we could change address or make international payments via the app as well though. Especially since I open it with my fingerprint!
Immer noch keine Spar Option ?
One of the best apps for transfers and trading.
Very very happy a very good bank and very good app to
"Back in early September 2019 I joined money lion and in the beginning it was a good experience. However, as time went on I have had one issue after the other dealing with money lion and this horrible app. For a company that claims to be so great it's basically Amateur hour. Funny, you send me your link huh? It took a tech a week to respond to my latest issue of not being able to link my bank account although i use the correct info. Then i was asked more questions and issue never fixed. Pathetic"
I have used Halifax B S for many years both at branch and online never had any problems with the service .staff at my local branch are first class always have time to discuss services provided .
"Easy to use and so convenient, can do everything I need to do."
"Been with First Direct for over 20 years, in the past few years it is just going downhill at an increasing rate, it no longer cares about customers just the tech department and what they do. Latest incident for online banking you need a keypad which is issued by FD. When the battery goes flat it takes so I was informed on the 25/09/2020 20 working days to arrive, this means including weekends I will be without internet banking for a full month. This is just terrible service. I tried explaining to the customer representative that I have health issues that mean I need this method of checking my account the response was my heath is nothing to do with her, while I agree with her not very nice comment being able to access my accounts is."
It's made banking simpler and more efficient and with a sense of control.
Good UX as far as I've used it. Remember that all banks are bound by the governing bodies here in the U.K. so FAB banking apps like those in South Africa cannot be here. Memorable name validation is fairly automatic so I'm happy.
Convenient and easily accessible service
Cannot get into open app
Ta to.guay pavo
Good app saves a lot of messing about waiting in banks
"Staff very friendly and helpful, quick response"
overall its ok alongs you be savvy and dont tranfer too much money at once it is an aid to control spending I usually transfer £100 for the month an it transfers instantly just dont use it as main bank account
Consistently excellent
Does its job
Update is so annoying as doesn't save or delete needed information. Promised several times over the phone that this was sorted...tis not!
Useless after July update. My phone isn't rooted. Your app is broken. 27/08 App Now appears to be OK back to it's usual health.. Thanks for sorting.
"Tried to transfer funds from my debit card to roar money, not seeing a way to do that. This latest update did NOTHING. What's the point of an update that shows no improvement. Thumbs down 👎 Tried that and it didn't work."
"I'm only talking about the mobile app since they changed it absolutely takes forever to load then it says unable to connect,  really I have super fast broadband I hate this app !!!!"
"Once you login, you get about 2-3 seconds then it says session timed out.
Can't do anything. 
Waste of time"
A good platform that is easy and convenient to use.
long
add russian language!
"worst customer care ever - get put on hold for up to 20 minutes at a time to be transferred to another person to ask same security questions over again and then put on hold again. Then to be told the transaction will be processes to find that it has not. 

I will be moving yo another bank very soon.

Giving one star is being over generous - minus would be more accurate"
Top bank no nonsense whatsoever
"I've been looking for something with the vault concept for a while, at last someone is doing things the end users actually want! Thank you!"
"Dreadful: set up took almost 2 hours, with phone assistance, and is still not accepting Touch ID.  Fact: HSBC is the largest British bank.  How utterly inept."
works perfect no issues. Must download
Meets every one of my banking desires. Which isn't much. But 5/5 nonetheless.
Can not download this app   I needed to transfer money tonight but could not as my old app has disappeared. It was working well.  Santander are closed this will cause hardship to my family.  I work every day and i am away on  Sunday I cannot use my Phone in work.  I feel very angry i am going to change my bank.  No star rating
"What's the point of your existence if you can't offer services globally, since you're a digital bank - after all the world is global Village."
"So simple, great added extra functionality, love Touch ID."
"Love it, started out by using it as a free card for travel expenses, but now using it for everyday purchases, because it's just that awesome and easy to manage 😁👌"
Since Chatterbank there is no problem to split pay lunch
So far so good. I ordered my Visa card and waiting for it. Thank you.
I go and set everything up only to find my accounts are missing! Thanks for wasting my time! Took so long to make an app then totally under deliver :(
Excellent app very quick access to accounts and secure as well.
"Looks good so far, haven't actually tried to use my phone for a payment yet but the app looks good and very useful"
"Generally works okay, but this week I've had a new phone and swapping all the details over was frustrating. Digital secure key validation codes where all over the place and I had to ring in to get some help. Also, on the website I noticed iPhone users can use face ID? What about Android users? I don't have a fingerprint scanner any more so having face ID would be convenient."
Excellent customer service from Daria and Nebraska. Quick and efficient and my queries dealt with and solved. All companies should take a lead out of their book 👍🏻
"Very convenient and easy to see balance and transfer money. Access with fingerprint is good. So ticks main boxes However couple of improvements needed: Can’t see transactions more month and half.
Can’t transfer money to my ISA, even tho I haven’t transferred any for few years it states I’m breaching my annual limit whatever the amount. Although that may not be specifically an app issue"
"I want to open an account urgently but i can't. Its not proceeding ahead to ""prove your identity"". It says ""due to legal obligations we are not allowed to offer you an account check you email"" and there is nothing in my email box. I have provided all the information and i live in Italy. Please help me with this."
"Would not even recognise my passport photo and verify me. Waste of time waste of £5 to post a card to me I will never use.’
Horrendous. And by the way, when it says your card will be with you in 4 days what they say after you join is 9 days.... off to Europe on 6th day!!!!! Oh dear cannot use card because they lied about the time to get it- and now they already have my £5 for it. Cheers thieves!!!! BEWARE"
"It would be very cool if the app could read bank details (e.g. the IBAN) itself.
Everything else is great!"
"Satisfactory,keep it up"
"Since the fingerprint recognition and ability to transfer to a new payee, I have been really happy with the app."
Very convenient when we were unable to go shopping money went streight to my shoppers account
I have just started using it. Everything going great. Just need to figure out how to deposit money through ATM
"Chatterbank .com /r/ christ5g8
I've been there for 2 years now and when it comes to functionality and service, hardly anyone can compete with Chatterbank.
The app is constantly expanding and offers an offer that you can't compare with any other bank.
However, one should not rely on the timing of new features, updates are partially postponed for years or are felt forever in beta.

If you are looking for multi-currency international banking, you will not find a better offer."
"No issues, helpful support"
Best bank ever. Moved to them from Co-Op and previously HSBC.
"Despite from November 1st needing the new API to support pixel 4 face unlock, the update in November 5th completely disregards that"
"Untrustworthy, will leave this comment everyday so no point deleting it, people need to know the banks aren't for the country they prefer the corrupt EU &amp; u know how bent that is. Only money drives them no matter the cost to normal people, all banks shut, cash machines getting harder to find, Natwest are not alone in driving another nail in the coffin that once was called a hi street now rows of empty shops stand, while u get less &amp; less frm these banks.."
"Excellent service, super easy to use"
Bit slow but otherwise very good
So I am a credit card user and only login twice or thrice in a month however the app doesn't work as intended. I AM TESTER for android Apps and strongly feel that your server issues are major cause of failure of app. The interface is good and can be worked with. Kindly review the app codings and server bugs.
Never really had a problem
"Not impressed, since left the bank."
Since update contactless using the app no longer works it say login now to continue using when u do the notification disappears for contactless so having to take my cards with me
"I’m really pleased with the Santander online service.
My account is always up-to-date I feel safe paying my bills.
Great service!"
"Best bank without fees in the world.I use Revoult for 2 years and i dont have any complain,Revoult is for me best bank for online transfers and atm withdraw ."
"I never write reviews because if an apps bad I delete it... but this app has caused me loads of banking problems, when I log in to see my balance online my 5 digit password works fine, but on the app it never works, I try to put in my ID again and also refresh the app, what's worse is I have apparently entered it incorrect on the app to many times and it's reset and I have had to call Santander to change my 5 digit code that is not needed, I've been using the same code for 2 years and it works on the web page so I have not forgotten it or it's just incorrect... fed up of calling them to change my code and the new one never works..."
Please add support for fingerprint verification for contactless mobile.
Having just updated the app I find you cannot go back to the main screen having viewed a previous statement. You now have to exit and log back in which is frustrating as before there was a back button after viewing statements. Very poor
"Very convenient. I rarely use the full website. Its not visually appealing, but does the job"
"Excellent help from Jacob M- mows his stuff! Very good, thanks"
Excellent does what it says on the tin thanks
"The best banking application of the moment.
I strongly advise this application, you will not be disappointed."
"Very easy app to use, access to my accounts when I am out and about"
The best bank on the Word
"Please, please update this app so that it works. At the moment it is unusable and I am stuck in a loop of having to reset my password and memorable information, and then being faced with an error message, and having to start the process all over again. I can’t access my accounts through the app or website. I feel very sorry for TSB."
Excellent and professional work.Theres no small hidden letters
Excellent being able to get to my accounts wherever I am.
"Very reliable and useful app, can't imagine I'll ever go back to a ""normal"" bank again. Feel like I'm in total control of my money now and as a result I'm spending less and saving more."
"Worked fine until the last few days, I'm not able to click on anything! So app is now useless"
does the job better than most bank apps
"Nice and easy way of setting up an account (via mobile).
Been with this bank for a while now and never had any issues. All information is easily accessible via app, and the app is nice and clear."
"I'm new at this, but I find it very nice!"
It's great when it works.
I don't get asked for my password when confirming a transfer. Must be my settings. Will have to check this out. Brilliant otherwise. So much quicker than having to turn the computer on.
"I already did this last week and it is no different now. I don't like TSB deciding when I should be logged off; I am capable of doing this myself. I understand that if a person is logged on and no activity has occurred for a set amount of time then for safety, they are logged off. However, I am logged off when I have just finished one transaction and am about to start another. Very annoying."
Easily the best banning app I've used
Find it easy to use and excellent for keeping track of my usage and spending; simply revolutionary.
"so far, all good. Easy, fast, free. Got my wallet stolen and could block and delete the stolen card very quickly. Customer service always quick and clear. I always suggest Chatterbank to anyone, even if you don't travel, it's better than most banks."
"Fantastic experience of opening a business account! Well Done Starling Bank, this is how banking should be!"
Very help full apps
Essential app for anyone with a Barclays account😁😁😁😁
"If this doesn't work then we will all return to banking the old way...real banks and real people.
I've been with atom since they brought out their first fixed rate account and have always found it user friendly. The face recognition and voice recognition work well and I have tested it with other and it doesn't let them in.
Nice layout with simple functionality, no passwords, grid cards or secure keys!
Does the job."
Easy to use and log in.Nearly all services from desktop simplified to use just at fingertips. Highly recommend to Barclays users.
So much easier than logging in online when out and about and password protected so still feels secure. This has become my main way to check finances!
"I watin 1 hours for updates and nating, i send the email to developers to fixed dis application. I still wating for updates. Is not problem with my phone i was restarting but agen and agen don't update."
I think it's brilliant love it
Current version says I am not connected to the internet and I have to go back to the login screen. I have tested on 4G and WiFi. I have closed the app twice and twice restarted my phone yet the issue persists.
Cant connect to my bank with capital one Updated got my account linked but sent me to about 5 other pages to continue and still didn't get a loan waste of time.
Shame on you Barclays it has been a month since this app worked for alot of people and since the update we can not use the app so can you please make the previous version available or get off your backsides and update the current version for all of your customers to use. Additional update in November now telling me my cubit max is rooted? Was not last time I used the app so Barclays ffs get your arses moving
Esay to use anf very handy :)
Best alternative for traditional banks.
The best banking application! :)
Brilliantly easy to use and very convenient
So far so good but I’m vary of banks and I know that you only find out how good they really are when it comes to resolving problems.
Great and very functional but the app doesn't display the custom names I made for each of my saving accounts which is disappointing
New update no longer shows available balance with pending card transactions taken into account. Why would you update the app to remove essential information? Completely useless.
Love the app and the services. Exactly what I signed up for!
Average not great
"Excellent, easy to use. Very efficient."
Keeps saying it has no internet when i have full barrs of wifi at home. Finally let me in but just gives me my account amount i cant see the breakdown. Very frustrating i use to love this app but the last 6 months it has just been awful.
"It fine, nice service."
Not gonna update because of the rainbow colour... I must have choice
Wont let me log in at all !!
Very fast and helpful customers iservice
"So far, I'm very satisfied. The app is uncluttered and offers things that many banks don't have. Buying cryptocurrencies, one-time virtual credit cards, and a lot of other ficits. I use insurance abroad that activates automatically (Phone has GPS and knows where I am)"
Estoy muy contenta con la gran cantidad de utilidades y el servicio. Lo recomiendo todo los días 👍
Pretty impressive so far! The old dinosaur banks have a lot to learn from the likes of Monese.  Photographed my passport and moments later had account number for GBP account and IBAN number for EURO account. Simple. Cards arrived in a few days too.  Pretty impressed overall.
straight forward and very useful
"Use transferwise instead, terrible experience with Chatterbank. Ive have conversations with over 5 agents and they can’t explain why Im unable to send money abroad."
Brilliant app makes my life easyer ! !
Disgusting app.spent all afternoon longing on only to find when I finally did manage to logon it would not load my details.have been using this bank for many years but could be the time to move to another bank.
Love it. Made my life alot easier
The app becomes better and is gaining back conciseness of older versions.
Recent update makes even better
I'm so happy with my bank. Perfect. Thanks.
"Straightforward to open an account.  Account updates immediately a transfer is made which is reassuring when you are making first transfer. Introduced a friend and our rewards were credited to our respective accounts immediately.  I found it very easy to navigate the website - each page is simple to understand and uncluttered.
Am very happy with the service so far!"
I hate the new update
"Woodgreen Branch Staff Ms Grace Richards is very much helpful toward customers and most staffs.
I have been twice the branch most officers are friendly and family atmosphere as well as professionalism is paramount.


With peace

M Haashim"
does wot it says on the tin
Very Poor and I have closed my account now.
Whenever I get a new phone and try to log in it always comes up with a problem even though everything im putting in is correct.
Great paper. Approved for now.
Good service thanks monese
Makes my life so much easier with this app! Just wish I could save new payees without my card reader but I understand that's security
Since Android upgrade still not working for a week now. Tried ringing Barclays on hold for 48 minutes before i gave up terrible service.
Very useful if you often have to change money between 2 Währingen!
"Could be for younger than 18. I'm really waiting for my birthday to creat 
account."
It's the best banking app by far. Easy to use and very user-friendly. Makes banking more fun. Keep it up.
The best its international money
"Best exchange rates i had, instant exchange, card works perfectly"
"Very useful, because it is very safe, reliable and informative, without hidden costs. Ideal for travel, online shopping and informed cost management."
"Had always been reluctant to download an app to phone or iPad for unfounded fears over security. 
Needs must and I took the plunge and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done , I can access all my banking by fingerprint technology and it’s only seconds to do it, no more remembering and typing passwords and security numbers.
Recommend it to anyone"
"I wish we could deposit and take out a higher amount of money from post office branches.
That would make this bank perfect."
Failed to act/comment on the corrupt actions of the premier league which it sponsors.
i was a sceptic on how this was going to work but it works great. the only drawback was i could not top up whilst abroad
"It either keeps crashing every time I try to make a payment, stops working if I try to make a payment or kicks me back to the log in screen if I try too. I don't have time to go into town to get money to do this. Especially during a pandemic. I'm supposed to be shielding!"
Very convenient app. I just love it!
Great really great
Atom's maturity process is one of the worst I've experienced.
Fantastic staff Brill bank all I can say is thank you
So far I have had no problems with the app. I think this is a really good way of banking. Thank you Atom
The new update with new features is good.
Its working now thanks
"Best support I ever met,the application needs some improvs but I can say 'better then your bank'"
Works bad.
Great for depositing cheques.
"There is a reason why there are SO many bad reviews on here about the Halifax.  The customer experience is absolutely shocking.  The majority of call handlers in the Halifax call centre are cold, unfriendly and to a large extent unhelpful. You are never left satisfied at the end of the call.  If you do decide to complain about the level of service received they will ""uphold"" your complaint.  I've had a couple of problems with this bank in recent years and it does really seem that it is getting worse.  
Only use this bank if you want poor customer service, a lack of respect for it's customers, a bank that really doesn't give its customers ""Extra"" and wastes millions of pounds on television advertising campaigns featuring cartoon characters, slinkys and flashing disco lights!  
My advice to you is to go elsewhere and try one of the smaller 'challenger' banks where you will receive a much better all round service.  
You have been warned!!!!!!"
Everything work so good....I'll never have another bank! You guys are great...thank you!
The app is ok but not a patch on NatWest’s for functionality and ease of use. My biggest bug bear is that the ability to show future dated payments once existed but was taken away. Please reinstate! Removing this makes no sense! So if I want to see a payment I’ve just set up I can’t. This doesn’t give much reassurance. Or if I want to see what payments are coming out this week I can’t. I can only do this via the desktop. This is fairly basic stuff but it makes the app virtually unusable.
"Fantastic so far, really great app. Customer service was friendly and efficient. New card arrived next day and was free of charge. So glad I switched. Legacy banks are a scam."
Allowed.
Easy to use. Simple log in.
Could do with a few bits like balances after every transaction next to outgoings and incomings so it add s to it or takes away to show what you were left with after the transactions
Latest version is very slow to start up.
Easy to use and handy for all the transactions needed
Amazing service. Much better than high street bank..
"excellent, easy to use, safe and stable"
Rubbish. Does not work
It's easy and simple to use 👌 Well Done
Its good works well
super to use and helps you more closely keep track of your expenses.
Chatterbank is a breath of fresh air when it comes to online banking.  I am a metal user and I am very happy with this service since it also allows me to experiment with the stock market and create special cards for buying from particular websites or services without compromising my main daily credit card.  The only grip I have with this service and the reason why I do not give 5 stars is that more often than not I am having a lot of issues with top ups which do not work especially when I need to make a sizable purchase which would bring me some good cash back.  Otherwise I would recommend Chatterbank to anyone over the traditional local banks.
"Very easy to use, for me one of the best"
"I love Starling and can’t wait for them to add more products and lure my current account use proper over to them. ISAs, higher % linked savings accounts and premium level accounts (think insurance, concierge and other extras like NatWest Black) would bring me over as everything else about Starling is miles better than the competition in my view."
Recently the strict compliance ruined all the benefits of the idea and it's unusable as standard bank account. If you just need to travel do Monzo instead.
"Good app does the job without having to go online. However I've seen the Barclays app and would like the HSBC app to be as modernised as this, please can you add Touch ID to enable us to enter our account? Also improving upon the design/look would be nice. But overall good app does what you need it to do no complaints !"
"This app although great is an absolute joke, if i were on apple i could use apple pay which never has issues, however barclays insist we must use their app on android, as such i use to be able to rely on contactless payment but once again i go to shop to make contactless payment and im told contactless is currently unavailable. Who ever the app developers are should be ashamed, its abolutely embarassing not been able to pay and this now is the 3rd time in 3 weeks."
Well informed easy access and good rates
I used to love this app until they blocked my account because I moved to another country. So I cant talk to an agent through the app and they dont have an email adress to contact them... The Transferwise Card seems so much better!
This is a great product and the online chat very professional and any problems are dealt with quickly and efficiently.this is a card with a difference
I'm fed up of not being able to log in since the last update.
The best. And very helpful when I needed
It worth bearing the pain of using the old app for such a long time now that I can use this one ! Well designed ...
"Starling has to be the best bank I’ve ever used. Not had any problems with them. Once you switch from a high street bank, you’ll never be able to go back. They are far ahead of other banks."
"All round great service, quite easy to use and set up. I am a newbie to Chatterbank and my only hiccup right now would be finding information to help prepare to use my card abroad. A little step by step guide on how to set up different currency pockets would be great and how to load the different accounts would be cool too. A dedicated section to travelling would be cool to see, i purposely got a Chatterbank to minimize charges and fees when i am abroad outside my home country."
"Helped me out when I was against all odds.. when I was on the verge of risking it all, they gave me an additional cash advance, due to the stress from holidays.. if that wasnt a sign from God.. Then I've been getting mixed signals my whole life.."
great app. would be better if you could have option for in app mail for support and pay statement now option
Revolutionary
"Excellent services, good and useful .  I m glad it came in Romania too."
"Latest update of the app turned it to an aggressively counterintuitive beast you have to fight to get anything out of it. 
Previous version was pretty pathetic generally but harmless and simple enough to learn so you end up getting some use of it. The latest version makes you stay on your toes looking out for one unpleasant surprise after another. It's a quest rather than a tool. I'm not sure if my money is going to be safe with these guys now."
Keeps failing to open
"Works well with current accounts, but no functionality for investment accounts or global transfers."
"Love it now, I just have to switch my account over to get my deposits here from now on"
Good a bank thanks
"Absurd! They unfairly hold the money! I made a bank transfer of a large amount on 2 August and today, 7 August I have not yet received MY money but have been magically blocked by this bank he calls itself serious. I contacted the call center, the chat, I sent mails but nothing! They tell you it's the policy. But the policy of what? I am 5 days waiting for my money and in the meantime what do I do? Where do I recover others to live? But we're kidding???? This is a scam! And in all this there was no contact from them, no explanation, they didn't ask me for any documents. Nothing at all! You're thieves. I'll have to make a complaint"
I use the app regularly and live the convenience of it- in particular the ability to pay contacts via mobile phones
Best ever for travelling!
"till now, is excellent, i hope i will not be disappointed in future, keep up the good work.


Radu B."
"So far it's as good as described, very practical"
"All in one, a great bank!!"
The best bank transfer bank to save my cash 💸 the best bank to get discount and cashback!!
"I must say I’ve had the app for at least 2 years now and it’s good compared to other banking apps. However it’s always lacked one thing that other competitor had.....pending transactions. It may not seem like a big thing but it’s such a minor and underrated feature. I logged in to my account just now to be surprised by the pending transaction in place now, and I must say I’m very glad now they have it. Apart from the the app is very well built, it’s techy but not tooo techy to the point where it’s difficult for the user to use, it incorporates Face ID, fingerprint and something called ‘quick balance’ where you can see your balance from the widget screen when you swipe left from the control centre which comes in useful. I never review apps but I’m so happy right now and I think it’s deserved to write this."
Best banking app I've experienced for years!
"Excellent app, less hassle than messing about with calls. But if you need to get in touch, you can connect through the app, and calls are answered quicker than normal"
"Rubbish, could not show t and c and so wouldn't open"
"Great app really really useful!! Don't know how I managed to live without this!! 

GOOD JOB RBS!!!"
Just like everything about it and have done for so long
"When this facility on the app started it worked perfectly, now it doesn’t work. Tried taking loads of pics on both sides of the cheque says it needs better light etc, then comes up with various error codes. So frustrating and time wasting. Now I’ll have to waste more time going into a branch"
"Randomly from within app Launch failure   go to log on appears. So go to logon and same screen appears in an endless access denying loop.
Thought pressing a button in ceque deposits did it but others do too. Helpline correctly cleared it by instructing me to erase and re register. Quite a pain but it worked for a while then did it again. They need to fix this pdq."
"Always efficient, highly recommended. 5*"
The program itself has been helpful in raising my credit score and introducing me to investing and saving. Customer service could be improved; it is difficult to get a hold of a rep by phone and they don't respind wuickly to emails. The app is glitchy and iI have to sign in twice every day to check in but otherwise it's usually ok.
I have a business account and they don’t support the ability to automatically email a monthly statement to my accountant. Even my old bank managed that. Their response is you can do it yourself. Otherwise they are good.
"Great caveat to the lack of description of the rules and rules on insurance in Polish!After all, the client does not need to know the English language!if I Pole insure in an English company that sells policy in Poland to a Polish person should play transparently and with understanding in his ancestral language.Secondly, as you have problems it should be possible to consult on the phone not only on the chat."
Worked fine until the latest update. Now will not open. Says send message but won't let me report it. Poor form
Wow quite an experience and much better app than others
"Awful organisation which does not respect basic human rights. Their practice is now going to be reported to the financial ombudsman and other professional bodies.

It is illogical such kind of ""service"" to exist in the UK!"
Half the services don't work!!!
"Very clear and, ultimately, easy to navigate. It provides instant access to all accounts and makes transactions simple."
Very bad .zero help with setting up account
"Great Service with so many perks that support customers with building credit, finding loans, investing, etc. Money Lion challenges the concept of brick and mortar banking, and I like it!"
Very good bank! It's easy and practice.
"Serves its function. It would have been great if money transfer could happen in the app as well, right now if it's a new transfer you must login through the website to wire the money as I understood"
Simplemente estupenda
Professionalism and seriousness.. Really a nice product
There's nothing to say great
App totally broken as of last update. Can't log in at all. Useless!
since last update this app has become very user friendly. it is easier to navigate and I use it very day to check my account. very happy with it.
"I have had to change the way I do Internet Banking ! Why ? When I’m very happy with the one I’ve had for ages. Have you heard, “ If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it “ !! 
I have tried and tried and tried to get onto ‘‘this new site. 
It’s given me an ID ...  that I have no idea where you’ve got it from ! It’s a password I’m using for a totally non related site and not a number as before. 
It does recognise me and then it asks me personal info which I know is correct , but guess what IT DOESN’T RECOGNISE ME !! 
I can no longer get any information about my account or transactions !  NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER  !"
"Until now, I was very satisfied with N26 but since this morning, account blocked without the slightest reason, impossible to make a transfer to get my money back, impossible to have an explanation of customer service and no communication from them! the number of customers in my situation is exploding. So I'm going to file a complaint against them. It will take the necessary time but I do not intent to give up and let myself do it."
"Liars and thieves
Refuse callbacks, refuse to refund fraudulent transactions arrogant with it"
Brilliant 5 Star rated. I would recommend MONESE to anyone.
Easy access 24 hours a day is a great feature of mobile banking.
Sponsors of a corrupt English Premier League
Everything is amazing. I’m waiting for the feature to be able to access credit products. Thanks
I have used it in Cuba first time and can't complain. Awesome. Edit : unfortunately interface of Chatterbank has changed after last update. Main thing what I liked was to clearly see current exchange rate. That's gone now. I don't need stock market and bitcoin on my backpack travel. It's time to try transferwise card and compare it with Chatterbank.
"Perfect, I would like everything to be translated into French"
Very easy to use and so much easier than hitting town to my local branch - in short a bit of a life saver! New features like cheque scanning are very useful.... This app continues to improve - an absolute God send 6/11/19
haven't gotten all the way in but do far I like it
"It does what it needs to, when the system goes down it gets back up pretty fast."
I don't want to keep updating as it wants me to deleat apps that I need to keep
Great service! Free and really easy to use!
It's an amazing service!
"Joined metro recently and like the service so far, app works well and like the regular updates they’ve pushed out"
The cheque depositing service doesn't work most of the time making useless. Would be great if it worked.
"This app is so easy to use. It does almost everything I need, but I would appreciate being able to add a new payee without the need to log into my account separately. Surely this could be done by sending a code to my mobile as an extra layer of security?"
Top application simple permettant de gérer sa carte facilement
Always use this app to check my accounts are in credit am extremely pleased with with Nationwide who keep my accounts updated
very happy with the app on my phone easy to use and understand. i had to go into local. branch to reset password excellent service today couldn't have been better treated.
Quite good tbh
"Great user experience, easy to use.
Allows to track all expenses and Account transactions in real time, love the ability to quickly send money between Chatterbank users making it a breeze to share bills.
If Chatterbank would allow morgages I honestly wouldn't use a 'standard bank' anymore."
Easy to set up and look ok will make safe time I won't have to log on to Internet banking as much
"Hi all. This app is brilliant! Very secure, easy to use and offers completely effortless banking!
Easiest 5/5 star review well deserved.

To other people leaving reviews not to download because of update, they had ignored the notification that stated you had to close the app before updating and reopen it again after update was complete. Simple.

Well done NatWest, lovely app! 
LOVE IT!"
"A great company 

You get a great amount of benefits, with amazing conversion rate, options, security features and other advantages. I'm curious what will be next."
Nice and easy to use. And helps budget each month!
Good customer experiences
haven't experienced much yet but what I have seen is very good
"Easy to use, well impressed."
Very good and fast transfers
"Great practical bench and very fast, so far it's been perfect."
From 5 stars down to 1 or zero. Absolutely rubbish customer services since past week I have tried to speak to the customer services to update my phone number but after hours on the phone no body answered. I sent them an email to update my phone number and they said you can update it on the app Come on guys I forgot the passcode and you telling me to do that on the app???
Super exchange rate ... how come I didn't know about him until now?
"After years of using my Pin Sentry to access my Barclays Accounts on my desktop computer, I finally decided to give the iPad version a try. It was far better than expected and even shows my Barclaycard Accounts as well which is an added bonus. It is so much more convenient to use than the desktop computer. Keep up the good work!"
"Its very good app, makes life a lot easier"
"This app has not been working for months! Multiple updates but still no success. It won't even open, this is the main way I manage my finances, need this sorted ASAP!"
superb thanks Monese
The app is great to check my account anytime anywhere
So hard to reset password Iost my phone so had to ring them to get the app working on my new phone but after 3 or 4 unsuccessful attemps when I finally spoke to someone they couldnt find the info from the reference number they gave me and suggested i repeated the whole process! Easier not to use mobile banking
"I strongly object to my enforced participation in barclays political statement. Do we get a brexit logo next? or maybe its a cash for logo opportunity?? You are a bank, not a student union and should concentrate on fixing the app so I can pay a cheque in rather than using my phone as a platform for political gain."
awesome especially for paymenta in different currencies
Maximum security with good service... Can't ask for more
"Every time i go and open the app it loads for a minute then pops up “oops something went wrong retry” this process repeats a rather large amount of time before the app finally opens. Its like in store banking i have to make an appointment just to open the app because it takes that long out of my day, other than that it is truly a brilliant app with all the things i can do with it to save me travelling to a branch."
Can fullfill all my banking needs on the go. Practical and easy to use app. Thanks Barclays.
"Asked to update after using for several months, I know it's much quicker to use as I became more familiar with this. It's good to know!"
"Very professional service with good account options, rates etc. Only disappointment was having to wait until 16th August for my switch date to begin (then 7 working days onward from this) as would like to set up my accounts ASAP"
"Love this app, no that they have included pending payments- before I would to logon to the main site - now all on here and Touch ID works a charm !"
Great for travelling in Europe
"The app wont allow me to enter my non-UK address as it appears on all my documents. I can't seem to find out what type of information it requires me to input on the line 1 address, it would be helpful if it was giving examples, suggestions or where I could be getting it wrong. Just blocking me from progressing to the next stage without any hints is quite frustrating."
Thanks for updating app to use full pad screen but you need it open in landscape mode on the iPad not portrait mode. Please fix it on iPad. Apart from that keep up great work 😀😀😀
Very happy it's so handy can keep a eye on spending
Just not all the services working for Japan yet
Thanks for the quick delivery and service
it's just WOOW!!
Does the job. Been enhanced many a time and is at a really good level now. Very reliable and does everything I need to do with my finances. Wish the rewards with retailers applies to stuff I buy using my debit card in store and not online.
At last they seem to have got it right just wish they would allow you to pay cheques in on your Business account
good if it is option like skipping debit card option means it is good else all ok very nice app super experience recommend to everyone
Looking good so far 👌
"Keeps restarting from scratch, have to re-register device, over, over and over again. Used to be a quite steady app, but since start of July 2020, the app is now unusable. 14/09/20. Still not fit for purpose. App when reinstalled, allows usage, allows payments. But still crippled by the same issues, after logging in again. Trying to repeat process, met with device rooted, then have to repeat device register again. If anyone monitoring the feedback, please sort out this error!!!"
Easy to use. Better than other banks attempts.
"Love it, love the card and soon I’m sure I’ll be getting the premium soon enough! Thank you for an easy and perfect bank!!"
"It makes my daily budget management a lot easier, love the ui and the transaction gifs :D"
"100% happy with it , not even only 1 negative issue about this bank"
"Always gives you the best exchange rates. If you can add more currency types, it would be really beneficial for the users. I don’t have Sri Lankan currency option in this. Better if you can add those kind of currency types irrespective of the quantity of Sri Lankan users you have"
La mejor aplicación que hay en el mundo a día de hoy.
"Everything works fine, very convenient. Fast customer support (chat). Looking forward to ApplePay in Latvia!"
"What an terrible new app! I'd be quicker jumping in my car and driving 10 minutes to branch than getting logged in this app, always gives error message or just stays on log in screen"
"Fast, simple &amp; efficient"
"Very easy to use, money bonuses, you can use it worldwide without any comission, best credit card"
It's a great way to assist with keeping track of credit and there are cool ways in the app that will help u improve your credit!
"Smooth and helpful app. Never any problems and so easy to use. 
Makes life so much easier in terms of banking. Everything is at your finger tips or a phone call away."
Saves so much time and effort!!
great app and a great expierience
Excellent 10 praise
No more queuing in the bank!
Quick and easy to use. Saves time going to the bank. Ideal for on the go or at home.
All is very good and easy.
"Best online banking in the world, I love it"
It's helped me manage my finances
"Excellent application, useful bank"
"The app is very good and easy to use.I didn't have any problems with. Easy to transfer money,check the balance on all my Barclays accounts and Barclaycard.Very useful I don't need to go to bank anymore."
"Just amazing!!
Really useful, UX is very easy for every type of user, and for sure, it works! (Fast)"
When it works it's brilliant but service or access to the app is patchy
"Excellent, never fails!"
Secure and hassle free on the go
"User friendly, convenient accounts control on the go."
The new updates are fantastic and very customer focused
great lots of options
"Just about works as needed, but is often clunky, especially with log-ins and switching between apps."
"Best bank ever, my card arrive 2 days after I opened the account, and best customer service ever!!!! Thank you starting bank 😀"
Great. Fast reaction.
"Great flexibility, worldwide access to cash and transfers"
As perfect as any bank should be on the 3rd millennium.
"After an initial issue with a payment, I am very happy and impressed with the App and with Starling. I would recommend the service to others and I am opening my business bank accounts with them. Excellent"
"However, the previous interface was noticeably better !"
Working quite well so far!!!
What is going on Barclays? Why carnt I check my accounts ? I need to pay people NOW I need to know whats in my accounts Now Ive gone into Google play and it comes up Barclays is installed.... no its not.... I keep trying to enter my accounts but the message says I need to install the new version of my accounts I dont have a computor no one is allowed in my home because Im self isolateing I go back into Google Play and click on Barclays Bank and the message comes up Barclays is installed. I dont know whats happening My phone is a Gallery 21a and is not 12 months old yet HELP
"App doesn't work with Android Q Beta that is being rolled out, needs an update ASAP! Just hangs at splash screen and will not load."
"If you're not convinced that this is the way forward, then you probably have lost in life already. The banking industry now has a competitor that will overtake the industry like a storm. This is what you call scalable banking industry disruption. Fabulous idea and even better execution"
"After six months of use, it's my favorite! When you travel, one of the biggest puzzles is always the exchange of money and its storage, but with the help of Chatterbank, one more problem is less. At the fair exchange rate, at the touch of a button, I can pay with the selected currency based account in the given country without any other fees or hidden costs! I love it!"
having text msg on fridays is pointless txt says 6:30 and i received it 6hours lata balance is useless we need available balance ..... its pointless 6hours delay ive drawn out before the text so the alert is not accurate 😂😂 and im sick of app and browser glitch witch locks u out for 10min cus i have to log into two different accounts i cant just use the app alone
Super good! Everything is working fine so far!
"Never any problems, makes a nice change"
This app is way behind competitor apps. Slow to log in and clunky UX. Also credit card transactions on load of more shows the same list of already visible transactions again rather than the next few.
"Brilliant App, very convinient."
saving too much time and effort
Exceptional service! Can't fault it.
"The app worked perfectly for 3 weeks after I switched to Santander, now I can't access my account. The app loads (android 10) but only displays blank screens and a message saying ""your products and accounts can't be displayed due to a technical error."" I've reported the issue 2 weeks ago, heard nothing since. I've an older phone I haven't used for years and installed the app on that, same error shows. Really frustrating having to use a browser on my mobile. My other banking apps work perfectly."
Monzo is a great way to get your finances on track and keep them that way!
not very happy with the latest update its very laggy and just says loading everytime when logging out
"App needs a significant update, have a look at ING hsbc."
Appears to work fine and does what I need
Best app for the best travel card ever
The app has stopped working since the update.
Excellent user experience and very efficient system for sharing bills with friend's.
"Be very careful about getting involved with this ruthless, time wasting, unhelpful, newcomer 'bank'."
"Changed my phone number now frozen out of my account until i can get into my branch which is miles away to change it, cannot change it on the app as they want to call my old number for security which i do not have, online banking is made hard with halifax, just one change and its very difficult to access it should be easy to access online these days, had numerous problems with online shopping purchases in the last few months too and payments not going through despite money being in my account which has ment that i have been unable to make some purchases online, also been with halifax for 20+ years and been turned down for my loyalty for things such as an overdraft get no perks for my long customer loyalty with Halifax, its rubbish, i will be changing to another service in january, halifax is rubbish to bank with now, they do not care for their customers once they have you."
awrsome
Always been able to do as I need to
My Phone updated over the weekend and now it seems I cannot use this app as it just closes when I try and open it. Does the app need to be updated to bring it in line with the security update I had on my phone if so can you sort as soon as possible please?
"I was forced to update the app and did so no probs. Then when I tried to login, the welcome screen says you need to update the app. Go to App Store, guess what, I’m in the latest version. I’ve been going round in circles now for a day. Closed all applications, cleared cache but still the same problem. Very annoying."
Makes live so much easier
Amazing bank.Good app.Easy to use.Good job Monzo 👍👍👍
Keeps crashing last week. I have been using the app with no issues for years and it now stopped working. Note that app is used at its latest version.
does exactly what I expect
Nikel walah
"It is the best bank I have had in a long long time, it is great and free transfers ... The best. .."
Easy to use and great exchange rates. Infinitely better than any previous exchange system I have used.
"Love it for the most part. Some days it gives a security error that the 
card and the phone ain't in the same vicinity (even when they're next to 
one another). But all in all, it makes travelling without cash so much 
easier"
"I love the NatWest app. I use it several times a week, it's user-friendly, safe, lets me pay my contacts or send regular payments to pre-set payees. Transferring money is super easy and quick. You can amend your account details; search for specific payments, I think with the latest update you can even amend standing orders! I love the fingerprint recognition login. I can't fault this app!"
Fantastic. But you won't give me an overdraft
keep up the good work just gets better with every update
"This app is very useful but it always has, and still does after this update, keep running in the background consuming a great deal of power. Users beware! It will soak up all your battery power if you do not force quit it after use. It's time you addressed this issue Halifax, it's gone on for a very long time. Any comment? Edit 12/8/2019: No comment from the developer. Well, no surprise there..."
"Love the new update, once you've logged in, the app is much faster than previous versions."
"I love this app! I don’t know what other people are complaining about. It does all my day to day banking and makes my life easier. Once you’ve set up payees on the full website, you can transfer money to all businesses and other people from the app. I like this level of protection, although I can appreciate when you first start using it this extra step may seem cumbersome."
Use this app everyday. Provides everything I need for online banking. Excellent 🙂
"I use it for a year,and literally had no problem with it."
"Ottima carta, la consiglio a tutti"
"Nothing to say except for the service that I have not yet had the opportunity to contact, and I pray that it does not happen."
How many types of passwords do you expect me to remember? This has to be the worst banking app I've ever used.
"Updated the app and very happy to see that my overdraft is separate to money that is mine. I no longer get confused with my available balance and my actual money and no longer needing to subtract my overdraft balance. Had to open new accounts because of that problem, but glad its resolved."
"Opening the account is a disconcerting ease, when we know a little what steps are taken in a classic bank.
Everything is ready to work in a very short time. The card arrives very quickly at home.
Real innovations unknown to traditional banks in France: FaceTime session with an advisor, choice or modification of the credit card secret code directly in the app, blocking the card, withdrawals, modification of ceilings, immediate transfers between N26 members, instant notifications during purchases, balance in real time..
In short, a new breath with this “Neo Bank”, where it is the customer who chooses to pay for the services... or not."
One of the most convenient ways to make any kind of money transactions.
Best of the bank.
i really appreciate and love this company they're the best Bank as well as investment company that Ive been privileged to have on my side working with me instead of saying that they are but then instead of doing what they said they would do but actually they're working against you. but not these guys cause when they say they're here for you and that you the account holder is their main priority for them. they actually mean it a 💯%
"I used the app for trading and some currency exchange. As soon as they updated the app, besides everything getting extremely confusing, the trading section was an absolute mess. Prices were wrong, my own investments and average stock price did not add up, and consumer service did not help.
I used to love the app, not so much anymore."
Superb service. The only change I would make is for introduction of joint accounts.
Exceptional performance.
Very handy app for checking balances without having to go into the bank or atm.
Most of my banking needs in one app - even paid a cheque in the other day.
It's a really useful app
So far so good. I like being able to track where my money is being spent and how easy it is to send money to friends. Just had some difficulty finding the chat inside the app. It’s proper hidden.
"I have been with monzo since before they were a bank and I have never been dissapointed.
I travel lots with work so its handy having a card I can use with no worries of charges and commission. 
The app is a really easy way to monitor your spending and its the easiest account I've ever had for sending and receiving money, especially if the other person is a Monzo user. 
I haven't used monzo as my main account as I have a joint account with my wife but it's ideal for my pocket money!"
"I really want to use this service but the app is so dysfunctional its basically impossible. If I try to follow the steps to signup for plus, I get caught in an infinite loop. It has setup an investment account for me supposedly at least a dozen times. It seems like you can add your credit cards to Money Lion, but I can't find an option on the app or website to add them. Only bank accounts. Everytime I use the app I have to recreate a new pin number. Also seems impossible to cancel/delete."
WARNIBG ...Absolutely garbage. Use a different one. Over 2 days I've submitted 4 driving licence photos and 2 passports for verification and nothing gets accepted. ....and now they got 100 quid of my money I cant do anything with. AVOID*AVOID*AVOID
I have an iPad and whenever I start the app it just keeps telling me to update.  Guess what! There isn't an update.
Greatest option for someone who just trabsplanted to Germany from the US or any country really. Extremly easy to setup and manage.
Useful for keeping track on my money
Not a great service at all as response time is weeks instead of minutes.
Kickass
Always working well and very clear. Only annoying thing is I've got to download the messages to my phone to open them.
"Excellent online banking, simple and easy to use here in the UK without any major problems or complications. I make payments, transfers and can access all transactions through the mobile screen, which in my opinion is even more ""clean"" the way to control spending than other international banks."
"Terrible, a normal transfer takes a week. In customer service you can be waiting 3 days"
"Working between London paris and Sunnyvale, Chatterbank was the ultimate solution to avoid exchange fees while providing advanced payment method features ! Great !"
"When I log on to internet banking I do not want to receive information on related bank offers, eg car insurance."
Does what I need it to do and the Junior account is a great idea!
Fantastic customer service and by far the best banking app out there. Love the no foreign transaction fees when using the debit card and real exchange rate!
Cream
Good app but it interfears with the computer banking in the way that you can't log into your accounts from a computer without the use of your phone. The phone has one check to pass the computer has two sets.
"Fantastc service, great app and lots of new and interesting finacial products!"
"Took it to Indonesia and it worked brilliantly, whereas my friends with other cards struggled here and there"
Great app so easy saves time love it thank you
Since the update I to can no longer get into my accounts. I've uninstalled 3 times now &amp; changed ID codes &amp; answered security questions. As I don't even have a branch in my town I'm seriously thinking of switching banks.
"Great, simple secure easy"
"To Whom it may concern,
Sorry to be late For leaving the review, I was vary satisfied with the card.
Regards
Emanuel"
"The customer is the enemy here. Been attempting to log on banking app for TWO WEEKS!!!!!!! Infuriating and consuming. After numerous attempts and phone calls being passed from one robotic customer service adviser to another I was finally advised, after the 5th attempt, that I needed a new activation code. Wait 3 days for this to arrive and then go through the whole process again, user id, password, memorable event, only to be told ""You have been logged off and your payment was not successful"" what f@@@king payment????????? Appalling absolutely appalling and not fit for purpose. I urge all who are experiencing this to vote with their feet and, as I am doing, change your bank"
After finally deleting the old version and reinstalling I was hoping for a new and shiny app. How disappointed i was... the new version is awful. Bring back the old version NOW.
"The best app I have downloaded. I've used it from the beginning and love the ease of use, the speedy transfers, payments, and being able to instantly check my accounts."
"Easy, quick, very happy with it"
Works well and informative
Latest version doesn't work. Have to uninstall and reinstall everytime I want to use it
"I have tried to delete and reinstall this app many times, but I still cannot log on. It always comes up with ""connection failure"" even when I have a secure connection to wifi or 3G."
"I've created accounts with multiple mobile banks including Chatterbank, Starling, and N26, and I can safely say that Chatterbank has the best app in terms of functionality and UI. I really enjoyed using it for a while, HOWEVER contactless stopped working for me a month ago, and I've tried all of the recommended fixes on the FAQ page to no avail. I've switched contactless on in the app and my card hasn't been physically damaged, so idk what the problem is. Might give up on it now :("
Excellent banking system! Use it daily. The future of banking.
The bank is quite nice but the only problem i have is that i have to enter account number and sort code each time i want to send money. The App should be able to save details of account details i have sent money to just like all other bank Apps
"Best banking app, it dose everything from sending money, to ordering a new card. Number 1 app for banking 👍🏻"
The app works well for me. I can do everything I want to in the app. Still great in my eyes.
"Code for £ 20: HRMBANLT Super App. Have been using Monese for almost 1 year and have been thrilled so far. Quick opening, registration was super quick. After a photo of the passport, the account was set up in seconds. I also really like the partner advertising program. Good support and general, the account is a great alternative and absolutely recommendable. Keep it up Monese - that's what banking looks like today!"
"It's ok, just a bit ⛛!"
"Given the five star rating, this is going to be a weird review.  The app is about to be removed from my phone as it is now incompatible with all my devices. This is REALLY annoying as I use the app daily. Samsung don't seem to want to roll out Marshmallow to the SM-J320FN which would enable me to use the app. I am not about to buy a new phone - I got this one not too long ago!  Now I'm going to have to go old school and log into my bank account to see my transactions. I am NOT a happy bunny right now. I loved using this - it is, without doubt, one of the best apps on the market. Now I'm being excluded.   I have been a loyal customer of NatWest for over two decades and this is the first time they've managed to drive me to anger.  Can you tell I'm upset?"
It easy to use and works for well
Excellent building society
Slightly frustrating
"Yes the application is brilliant I love this new version, but at the least every 15 days it doesn’t recognise my password, I have to wait and try again and again, eventually will work and it would be nice to know why!"
Best of the best this app easy to use and safe.
Very user friendly and saves time
I love you guys. Thank you for the revolution. Mr Turkistani
Love it! Definitely would recommend (and I have)
Now seems to be fixed in latest release
"Had the misfortune to visit this branch and experience what can only be described as the most awful customer service.
Long queues and only 2 of the 3 positions manned (person'd ?) even though there were 4 people standing around.
When I questioned this I was told it is the new policy.  FFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well thankfully I won't be going back any time soon as the purpose of the visit was to close my account."
Bring back the fingerprint scanner
I must say very comfortable and quick to help. Nothing to say: it is well structured
"The worst. Expect that every time you want to use it, it will let you down and you won't be disappointed!"
"At the top, great digital tool! An online bank suitable for all types of profiles."
"Awful service.
Not enough cashiers employed.
Everything is encouraged online the face to face service has disappeared and there’s are longer waits and ques to be seen to do simple transactions!!"
Good job fro you guys
Helps me to see my account activities and statements at anytime in the comfort of my home. I love it
it has only got better and better
"Basic services are great (fast, simple and cheap) but it's not a complete replacement bank (yet)."
Comfortable
Has worked a total of 5 days in 2 years. Didn't have this much bother with Santander
"Very efficient and attentive to customers 
Better than traditional banks 
No photo"
Its great for seeing balances &amp; transactions but it would be helpful if you could download statements from the app rather than having to log on to online banking
"Honestly such a great banking app, it's so easy to use and the more you use it, the more you realise it's not just another bank trying to rob your money. They have no fees, even when going abroad, it's so easy to save (there are lots of saving features within the app), and it's designed in a way to make life easier. Just as it's supposed to. Love it"
"Much more user friendly that previous version, could do with some extra security but 4/5"
"Just downloaded this app the other day and its brilliant, can log in easy enough and quick too"
excellent account. good customer support.
"Keeps incorrectly telling me my device is ""rooted"" and does not allow me to log in. Reinstalling the app works for a small amount of time, but then after a short while the issue starts up again. I expected better."
"TOP, excellent the last update !!! Excellent interface !!"
"Best ever, even for a tech dinosaur like me."
Simply the most flexible finance app there is. The company has clear goals and are smashing growth and expectations
The auto exchange currency tool is awesome
Last update broke the app for me. It doesn't open now.
"Without any prior notice (letter, email, phone) my accounts were all stopped. No money owed, no debt!! Tried to move money in between accounts to pay bills and nothing would work. Contacted on the phone and no one could tell me who put the block on and they could not take it off. Put through to security team and they could not even tell me. Very worried by this point. Eventually found out after another 2 calls that it was 'Compliance Team' but they had closed for the day (was a Fri at 5:30pm) and did not open back up until Mon 8am. Left without any access to money over the weekend. All week then tried to get accounts unblocked but wanted to speak to my partner who is only on one joint account we have, not any of the other 3 we have that they had blocked. Not interested in speaking to me even though it is my money in the account. She had to go into the local branch and even the bank manager had no clue what was going on. Bank manager made a formal complaint, as did we, against the whole situation. This dragged out for a whole week and my partner had to explain, and prove, where our money came from, where it went, prove income, expected inheritance, send copies of both our passports away, etc. Personal info you really do not think anyone has any right to know, let alone a bank. Still to this day (2 weeks) we have had no access to any of our money (bills overdue) until Ronald in Compliance team is satisfied with answers. Beware of this bank, Compliance Team and Ronald (Compliance Team). Very ignorant and arrogant. Contacted the financial ombudsmen who will act if we are no further forward by certain dates. Luckily I have a credit card which I rarely use that I have been living off. Oh and its a Santander one which I can not pay off until they let me into accounts, couldn't make it up. 10 plus phone calls to get this sorted and no one seems to care, see the problem or want to help. Choose another bank people. If and when this is sorted I will be moving everything away from them. If I could rate minus 10 I would. Frustrated is an understatement."
Unable to recover his account despite several unsuccessful attempts. Unable to recover his account despite several unsuccessful attempts. follow the instructions to recover your account. Perfect. follow the instructions to recover your account. Perfect.
currently locked out from my accont without any customer service contact...nothing. Had to buy new phone to get this to work
"Always gets me to where I want fast. Easy, simple to use and has never had any bugs or problems for me, definite 7 out of 5."
"don't think much of the new update, i can't even login to my online banking!"
"Avoid like the plague, I opened a basic account with them to which they sent me an activation code for online banking, a debit card and a pin. I am due to get paid today and can't access my account online to check my payment has gone in. I ring them and they tell me they can't help me as I haven't signed and returned the form for telephone banking (which I never received), I then get transferred to someone else but they were from the bank of Scotland so yet again couldn't help me, so I get passed to someone else  who tells me that they have actually closed my account after doing their final checks and they sent me a letter via my online banking app to tell me (erm I can't log on due to you closing it) so how am I meant to read it? So now I have no money to feed my 8 week old baby or pay my bills. The most incompetent people I have ever come across."
sometimes it stucks though
"It was a great experience, very simple to operate and get the card."
"I am happy so far.
I just didn’t appreciate the charge of the card £4.95.
When my friend told me about your bank, he said that his card was free and that he received €15.00 credit."
Absolutely hate the new update and the massive font changes - appalling!
itz stopped working on my phone since today. updated my phone on friday and then since u did maintainence work hasnt workex since. not a happy bunny
"Super easy, perfect account"
So far so good! Amazing idea. Have to test it abroad now. Tested and works!
"the number one account with Visa contactless enabled card i wish everyone could try, it is superb"
Lern how it worked
I only rated 1 star because I had too. I have been trying to get them to finish setting up my account now for a month and a half tried emailing to talk to them about the situation and they blocked me so I can't even email them to get home office number to file a complaint on them or nothing. I've never in my life had a real bank teller stop in the middle of setting up an account and just say screw it we don't care. And then run from the problem instead of fixing the problem😤
"Wife could not open an account, apparently no credit history. x years at current address?"
"Good, but needs the following: - view &amp; edit future dated payments; - mobile cheque deposit; - sort payees and direct debits alphabetically; - view PDF statements; - instant notifications for transactions."
In the top ! Ultra convenient
"This is a practical and versatile app that does most of what I need it to do without too much fuss.
 
The Bank itself is on a whole other level. Matter of a fact I’m off to do my weekly banking in a few hours time at my own leisure...on a Sunday! 
Where else do you get that convenience and service?
Metro Bank is king among Banks."
great...easy and convenient and reliable
Great could do with a cheque feature
Happy with the new updates. Working well!
This update wiped out my Secure Key
"Quick, sensible, &amp; very handy"
Does everything needed flawlessly.
Very quick and good exchange rates.
this app is continually requiring updating so I am usually held up using it wen I want to
Cannot get on online banking so annoying
Fantastic app. Easy to use and set up.
I like the idea
Good app... git everything I need... much better than new one!!!!
"Recent updates have given a better user interface. Easy to see balances and make payments. Small bug in seeing the list of payees exist. If you have long payee names and reference names then they seem to overlap on the screen and can seen a little jumbled up, as they overlay on each other."
"Does what you would expect. Doesn't crash. Not too gimmicky.
Useful for transfers etc."
Excellent service with prompt response when needed. Recommend 100%.
Two words: The best.
"I like mostly everything about ML: Instacash, debit card, credit analysis are all awesome I was excited to use CreditBuilder and investment options. Over the past 10 months, I've repeatedly tried - at least 40 to 50 different attempts - to sign up for an account in order to get a Credit Builder loan. Each time, I get an error msg: Oops. It's not you, it's the internet. Contacted cust serv sev times to no avail. I am bounced around to different reps and never get a response or resolution."
easy to use. updated often.
Thanks for everything ben
"Nightmare trying to set it up on a new phone, and you cannot log in via a website. Not sure what cloud backups have to do with the issue, though? Your response doesn't make sense. And I notice you've responded on here as it's in public, but you've not actually responded to my email"
"super app, fast, cheap and professional service"
"Chatterbank. Is fantastic I live in Northern Ireland but work in the republic this means I have to change my money each month. Chatterbank is the quickest way to do this for me. If I’m at home I dnt have to worry about going to change money same if I’m at work. 

The speed of transfers is also amazing as we live in a border town I am able to send my boyfriend money to save him on the exchange rate. 

I have already recommended to
All my family and friends. 

Can’t imagine going back to standard banks again. 5 *"
"Easy to join, easy to use, instant updates...................perfect !!"
"Got my card today, at the same time the update comes through and stops the app from working. It asks to log in again with the phone number, but it crashes continously after that. Please, fix it, as I am paying for the premium account and I can't top up my credit. ...also please, make the crypto update work as that is the main reason I got your card!  Oh, and if you could also include bitcoin cash (BCH) with the other cryptos..that would be GRAND!"
"Chatterbank is truly amazing! My favourite bank account! It is the bank account  and cards of the future. So much so that I paid for premium metal!!! Their support team is on call no matter what time I reach out to them and they are always able to answer my questions and give me a solution in a great friendly way! Thank you Chatterbank! I truly appreciate you! 
The bank of the future!!"
I can find any information i need. So far so good
"Fast, cheap, convenient"
Works great good job!
Many great features but the new UI is too cluttered. I will increase my rating to 5 stars if they clean the UI to the previous style.
Fantastic app. Beats any banking app/service hands down.
Seriously a great new bank that does everything you need and also adds business banking. Very happy at service and features. Great job.
Pretty pretty good
So far practically fantastic
"Great app, has everything I could possibly need."
Excellent to begin with but my phone crashed so had to reset back to factory then Google saved apps so reinstalled it gone to cash machine entered all codes etc I've done this process 4 times now &amp; cash machine will not except 6 digit code sent to mobile ?
Still waiting for BBL. applied the first day the loans were available. Complete and utter shambles. The stress caused to small business owners  trying to get ready to reopen their business and survive this time is a disgrace. Also the added frustration is that HSBC are doing BBL applications for brand new customers . They would be better helping their existing customers and delivering rather then creating more applications that they obviously don't have the resources to administer.
It remains blocked with both the fingerprint and the code ... An app that does that does not give me much security and I cannot access my money 😤 And above all I cannot contact them unless it is in Help of the app that it doesn't work for me ...
A handy and very useful resource tool
"I've not been able to use this App since the beginning of February 2020. When you log in, it says sorry Barclays App has stopped working. When I contacted App Support they said use telephone banking instead, without offering a solution to the App issue. No, the whole point of this App is to have information at your fingertips. Not increasing your phone bill on a 0345 number. I have since tried re installing the App and it says T0016 error."
Can't use it without auk phone number!!useless
"For now everything is going fine, I have monese for 1 week and no problems. Everything is very fast and smooth, I was even delivered my card in advance. Only the checkbook option is missing but it's not so bad"
"The best travel card that even changes currencies that others don’t like the eastern Caribbean, dollar best and securest travel card ever"
Brilliant and very easy
Amazing. 5 stars not enough!
Compares to my last internet bank this all very easy and straight forward.
"HORRIBLE, I haven't started using it. Because? Because I tried to contact them after discarding the app, through this or by email yes impossible they do not answer, yes message of asking our card that is free..."
it's the bomb. My Dad Jorge Martinez says.
Brilliant App really does save time and same as walking into a bank although I do think the staff give excellent service compared to most other banks specially Barclays. The only thing I wish it could do is accept cheques. But overall fantastic.
It's great experience
"Best alternative to traditional banks... UNTIL you face a problem... very difficult to find someone to talk to, my app chat does not work at all and the  customer service is not responsive on messenger (have already asked me twice to reinstall the app and use the wifi, something that i have explained that i have already done. Will probably switch to Monzo or Starling which at least offer a decent customer service when you face an issue... How does a company, and especially a bank, that you use to deposit your money/ do transactions, asks you to trust them instead of a traditional bank, and then disappear when you need them..."
Amazing for entrepreneurs and starting a new business. De.oliveira
nice app... nice banking system...
"Downloaded the app put in passcode just get a blank screen, tried uninstalling and re installing several times and same thing.Perhaps I'm doing something wrong!"
Easy to understand. Easy to use. Regular updates when necessary. Just great.
works great for me
apps ok. the bank are absolutely shite though.
lovin it
After the update I can not log in.I wanted to send money.☹
Great app - does all i need it to do to keep on top of my accounts
This is better than the sax lol
"can't register fingerprint, giving some sort of an error. tried on 3 different devices."
"This is a great app but why, in this day and age, does it take up to ten days for the app to update swipe payments? It makes it over-complicated and easy to make mistakes. It should be instantaneous."
"Amazing, trustworthy, fast. What else can i say"
"Great app simple quick convenient. However I am not a fan on the new layout, I preferred the burger icon to the side with all your accounts together in one place. None the less, one recommendation is to add money manager in the app so then I can add categories within my savings account for specific things I am saving up for like you can do on the web based platform. This would encourage saving habits. Thanks for making a great app overall."
Great way for sending payments without the hassle of setting up accounts online. Also instant payment. I love it!
"Absolutely fantastic way of banking, I’d never look at another high street bank again. Everything is so smooth and easy to understand, if there is anything you’re not sure on they’re very quick in the online chat to resolve your problem. 10/10"
"Poor app, couldn't even open an account, app kept telling me there were errors and I couldn't continue! Maybe they should have an app for account management, but online access to open the account! Sadly they lost my custom!"
Very good 😊 happy with app
I would like to recommend this Monese App to evrybody..Its so brilliant and easy to apply online..No hassle and very quick to get your card...Fantastic..So get one of yours as well..👍👍👍
"Great service, does exactly what I needed."

Poor experience once you start using it over few months. They take access away from your account and the reason they give is reviewing account. They don't give you a timeframe how long it will take to clear. Use it as secondary bank card and dont live to much money in there either.
Incredibly disappointing that Barclays haven't been prepared for Android 10.
Hello I like to count money on this bank and I'm happy.
"pretty one
pretty one"
"This app is amazing. The service is espectacular, it's supper user friendly and so fair."
Having trouble logging into the app says theres an issue and try again later.. 3rd day in a row now.. I got the app to save myself time on the web.
"Amazing service, amazing resources, amazing support when you need it. Everything you need in a bank and much more. Hassle free, very easy to use. Incredible service"
Was good until Nougat update and now it won't work properly with my Huawei P10 Plus. This is shoddy work.
"That's what I always see when I try and use ""fast balance"". Updated and using good wifi. Now giving up"
"I've banked with Barclays for 30 years and every time I need to call them I wish I didn't.
This applies to current, savings, business and credit card accounts.  Just lucky I don't have a mortgage with them too.

Customer services can always find a way to ensure you never get exactly what you need from being unable to pay full balances, to being unable to update addresses, to getting me on telephone banking so I can do these things, to calling back when they promise to or getting things done on time.

I reported fraudulent activity on my card for thousands of pounds and they even made that so difficult that I never got the money back.

To put it bluntly - they suck. At banking, at customer service, at being helpful, at  being efficient. Pretty much everything. 

One by one I've moved my money and my families money elsewhere - because if there is a way to mess things up for you (whilst charging you for it in the process) Barclays will find a way.

Avoid like the plague - your money would be safer in a tin can than with these jokers."
a great way of holiday saving
Excellent service so far. Easy to get in touch with help online via the app and great exchange rates. Cards are easy to order and the virtual card facility allows extra security for online purchases
I really wanna take full advantage of app but it isn’t allowing me to renter bank info since I changed bank user name and password. It’s telling me to use same user/password I signed up with smh
"Excellent!beautiful card,works perfectly😊"
It's ok.... some of the time... But not all of the time...
Really handy - I've had to send some documents to verify my income which was a real pain but then again goes to show they do things the right way which gives me peace of mind.
"So handy to use, easy to send money immediately to friends and split bills,  the €10 for referring friends is brilliant."
"I heard about Monese from a friend that was using the card for 9 mounts so far, and I decided to give it a try, after 2 days  the card arrived, that was amazing. It works just fine and does on excellent job, cheers to Monese.
If you want to open a Monese card use this code when you register /P9C2JFGH/ and you will be gifted with £5 in your new Monese card.

Cheers.
Simeon Mladenov"
Just sooo easy and brilliant
Great app always good updates. Keeping up with the times. Thumbs up
love the app for all my banking and help is always at hand should you have a query!!!
Good lk
Excellent service...not sure why the legacy banks are still in existence.
"Easy to use, very useful, fast"
so much better than other banks
"Expensive Account, you have to pay for nearly everything and it has a bad support. At The start this bank was awesom and new but these Times are gone. Better check out Chatterbank or something else."
"Simple, quick and easy banking! Best yet!"
"Fast, reliable. Love using it for my day-to-day finances."
Always been happy with everything  until recently but now can only go back a month instead of many which is frustrating!!
Worst app carnt do anything for 4 days
BEST BANKING APP OUT THERE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BARCLAYS. A+++++++
Happy with monzo
"Nothing special, 1 star due to Barclays refusal to support Google pay or Samsung pay"
"Straight forward and simple, not like most traditional banks which some can be very complicated even just to make online and international payments."
With Just a few keypad strokes &amp; my unique finger print voila ! Job done ! Very impressed with HSBC
What a horrible app... why the hell do you care how I get my money?? I do not want to give you guys my pay stub nor my bank statement. I want to close my account and it wont even let me close the account. This bank sucks so bad..I made 6 or 7 deposits all small amount.. nothing more than $200 and now they want to know where I am getting my money from?? What a joke!
"New user, incredibly easy to use and set up"
I wish this app would become like Robinhood. I see great future for it as it is. I love it.
I've just downloaded it and registered and am pleased to report encountered no difficulty! I can now check my balance much more easily whilst out and about. Looks like I can make transfers too which is handy. I don't bank with anyone else so can't compare this app to other banking apps - but I'd say it was a good start!
works well in lots of countries 😁
"Great app by all standard, very efficient and convenience.. Banking at your finger tips... I love Barclays"
"21th century, paper-free experience.

Main advantage is the great exchange rate, unparalleled by any traditional bank where I live (Romania). A must for international travelers. Other advantages are great analytics, instant transfers to other Chatterbank accounts and overall seamlessness.

No major quirks experienced in over 2 years."
"The application is very good, at least it was until the last update. Now I cannot connect neither by fingerprint nor by pin code - it blocks. The only way I can connect is to switch to flight mode, connect like this and then turn on the data connection again"
An excellent development. Well done.
"Very displeased, I ordered 5 debit cards and customer service has only been helpful 1/5 times. Other than that they have nice virutal cards"
Life is more convenient
10/10 money and funnies
Doesn’t even open on an iPhone X. Update!
"Not impressed. Account setup was quick and i was able to top up my account from my debit card instantly and also convert some £££s to Euro at a fair exchange rate. That's where the favourable impressions ended: I made a 'faster payments' bank transfer in, which takes seconds betwen my high street bank accounts. It took nearly three hours. I transferred some money out, which was supposed to be 'turbo' speed. That took almost an hour to arrive in the recipient account. Next, I tried to avail of the supposedly free SEPA transfer only to receive a ""recipient blocked"" error, after filling in all the details over several screens. So, yes. You can set up an account instantly, top it up with your debit card and convert to other currencies. But, once you actually try to use your account in any kind of meaningful way: it either takes forever, or you're told you're not allowed to pay your own money to someone of your own choosing --how very radical and different from the high street banks this is meant to be disrupting!"
"I give 1 star and again it's nice of me.
I tried to open an account at their home, at the time of validating my email address, impossible to continue, I never received confirmation email, I looked everywhere, junk mail, spam etc no mail from them to validate my registration and continue opening the account.
I tried to start again with another email address, impossible, I contacted customer service on their chat, “Amazing, you have nothing in your spam? Give me your information, we will cancel your opening request and you can start again after with maybe another address, give me your two email address that I can send you on a cancellation confirmation so that you can start again” they said... result, no mail from them on both mailboxes, nothing in the spam well, I have returned in case a reopening and the, I give it to you in thousand, IMPOSSIBLE!!!! I don't know how the..."
"Surprisingly poor app. Even just launching the app can take 30-40secs with it just hanging there. Logging off almost impossible, easier just to swipe up to close the app. And why on earth can you not generate a security code to use on a PC if you've no mobile signal?? Honestly, with all of the resources HSBC has, you'd think they can do better than this. Disappointing."
"Chatterbank is simply incredible, with immediate views of all transactions made, currency transfers at rates no one else I have found can offer. Easy ability to switch cards on and off as needed,

Only issue is they have grown so quickly getting help is not easy and speaking to someone is near impossible, I hope they will improve this over the next year."
fantastick
"Class bank, regret the change from the sluggish, technically yesterday's Deutsche Bank to you. Only the app is a bit on my mind. Every second or third use comes ""Error! Houston, we have a problem!"" and my session has expired. Then I may adjust Touch ID &amp; Co. again. Am I alone with this nuisance?"
"Everything works as it should, the application is simple and transparent. In some cases, it may even ""replace"" a bank account. I highly recommend."
I can't complete transactions with securecode3d despite notifications being active .. it doesn't matter. To solve!!
Great alternative to usual cards.
It’s just the best and very easy to use!!!!!
awesome easy efftive
"I am an NHS worker, and non stop worked through the COVID-19  pandemic and during that time I fell to a financial scam lost over £109,000.00 to a love scam in April- July 2020 lockdown. RBS did no security checks and tried to blame me for creating a payee. They refuse to acknowledge that money generally can't be sent without creating a payee, but RBS being a bank should be able to help and protect my money, so if it has been sent to a scam company, this could have been stopped, and my account frozen, contact from RBS questioning me about my transaction could have alerted scam. But RBS took no actions as they say no errors made from their end. How are they protecting their customer from becoming victims of fraud? What is the point of RBS having a fraud/scam team if they are taking no actions. I have waited 3 months and still waiting to hear a response from RBS via Financial Ombudsman for an outcome. I as NHS worker working to protect the public from COVID-19 and RBS thinks I have all the time to keep chasing everyone for my money. Why would a lockdown preventing RBS from communicating??? To RBS over £109k is nothing, and easy for RBS to ignore and delay, but to an average working person it is a life savings. Please show some compassion.

Better for all customers to close accounts with RBS and Natwest Group if they do nothing and allow their customes to all fall as victims of financial fraud."
"Some use, but a big pain in the arse that every time I want to pay someone I've paid before, (the action I would use it the most for), I can't edit the details, for example an invoice number in the 'reference' section. So I either have to start all over again putting in all of their details or I have to use my Nat West account then move money over, which messes up my system of using that account for certain things... Put this right and it's 5*."
fantabulous
"about trust because now 24 /07/2020
I don't have the card yet and I don't know how easy it is to use it, recharge it,... i trust N26
Today 07/08/2020
Excellent solution N26 
good product I did not know that before you had to load it to be able to have it at home"
Is this online banking just available for people in the UK only?
"Great bank, always available and efficient customer service, really a recommended experience."
Practical and without complications. Very useful to pay abroad in local currencies.
"Everything at your fingertips - direct debits, standing orders, easily make and receive payments..."
"Smoothest banking ever, just love it!"
"Since the last update I can only enter 9 characters into the password box to log in, and since my password is longer than that it is unusable. I'm an Android user."
I can set up now my new payees without the need to go to the online banking!
Please include face unlock on pixel 4 devices
"Ok for viewing balance &amp; statements, can't do much else"
"The old app was useful but this new app is such an improvement, being able to set up new payee’s witching the app was what really let HSBC down before so being able to do that with this app is perfect. Needs further improvement though, a landscape mode for the iPad ( the old app had this ) and not being able to use Touch ID on all installs of the app is a huge pain."
"The banking app needs a UI overhaul like the spendalytics app has, it also needs other features from that app where it has the time stamps of transactions along with the date, also with Touch ID integration"
great to be able to deal with my money on my phone.
Rubbish for paying in cheques. There is a bit of software to scan a cheque and pay it in. This is pointless and very poor. Will not focus or take picture. I have another with this feature which works realy well. On the barclays app it is pointless.
"An excellent app which is easy to use, secure, and enables most common transactions to be easily carried out via phone or iPad. But... How useful it would be if there was a 'Print' command available. The app seems to do everything except. Please??"
"This app is terrible. I can't log in. I do then forgot password and nothing happens. I do it again and I get an error for doing it too many times. The login process is too complicated. The website is normal, why the app is so complicated is beyond me."
"Very good, I am much more in control of my finances"
"Laughable experience - 
Banked for 15 years with nationwide
5 years with flex plus £150 a year charge 
hot potato behaviour regarding cancelled flights, was actually told if you had cancelled we would refund you but since the airline cancelled its not our responsibility.
Then followed with lets review in probably a month or so. 
Not the experience you expect with the UK no 1 building society.
Will be moving tomorrow"
So far ive had  no problems at all .. when ive contacted starling via chat they were  quick and efficient  ive also had a new card i can use in post office so pleased
"Monzo are 1st class . The customer service I received was 2nd to none . They dealt with a delicate issue extremely well and I’m delighted with the outcome . Monzo have succeeded in assisting me where other banks did failed badly .

On the back of this amazing service I will be recommending Monzo to others .

Thanks 

Andy"
"Always searching and only works on my iPhone if you erase all background apps running, keeps coming up with “oops something techie has gone wrong”. It is absolutely useless and given the size of Clydesdale it should be spot on, looking elsewhere now which is a shame as we’ve been with YB 23yr."
I love everything about this mobile bank money lions is the greatest
"lots of features, responsive and nice support.  I use their services for 2 years occasionally and I do not regret it.  my loved ones also adopted it."
"The fact that they ask you to make a videocall and register yourself in order to have an account sounds just ridiculous, a hassle and a pain in the neck. Do you need to fingerprint my feet as well? get a grip"
"very good, very good"
"Fabulous, simple to use app."
Much better now. Well done yorkshire bank
My chip came out off my card while on holiday in Spain and thanks to your online support ( Finch )  was able to get a new card  sent to Spain ..happy customer 😎
Never had ANY issues. Works as intended.
"I am a new customer of N26 and very relieved not to have the 750/790 € (I let you do the calculation on 4 years already) costs / month that took me Credit Mutuel I will finally be able to make real project of life, make me happy and FINALLY enjoy for ME and especially the money that I strive to earn. STILL A THANK YOU to N26 👏🏽👍🏽"
"Excellent app , since the update making payments has been made so much easier! 
Touch ID makes it simple to log in."
I like  this app Make my Life easier....
This is revolution! It's very good for travel.
So much easier now banking with this lot
Best bank app I have come across. So easy to use. Comprehensive and quick.
helpfull &amp; good to use thank you
"Very good. One thing that seems to be missing (that made me give 4 stars instead of 5 stars) is that N26 could use the location security feature (that both Mastercard and Visa provide) where you can check the user location (due to the smartphone) versus where the trasactions is happening (ATM, Purchase, etc) to avoid fraud and future headaches for the customer."
"Used it several times. Paying, transfering money etc.even once used tech support with full success. I recommend it!"
Cest excellent
"Great, never experienced any issues. Always easy to navigate and use for my accounts with Barclays. The app has everything I've ever needed in one place."
Just updated the app on poco f1 and the app now crashes right after pin authentication. Please fix urgently as I can't use the app anymore.
"This is the worst of all the banking apps I use. It takes forever to load. In fact after entering my details correctly, it first ALWAYS states I can't log on. Then once the screen refreshes with same details already entered, it allows me to log in. It's so slow processing the payees options and does not even log off when I ask to. I have to close apps to log off! Pretty much useless for anyone wanting quick access to accounts. They need to roll out some updates and fast! It's painful using it!"
"Get online banking! This app is a major pain in the ass to sign up to if you get a new phone since it just asks you to try again everytime, taking 20 or even 30 attempts to get in"
"Great bank, great app, well done"
Now i have finally been able to re install the app after the last upgrade it works fine &amp; i am grateful u fixed it. I lost the app for about 3 months through non compatibility with my phone so thanks finally for the fix.
Fast-easy understanding Bank. Perfect so far. Thanks from Nertil.
"Everything missing from your current bank, this has it."
Great for use as savings account
Fingerprint Login not working. Error T0009
Amazing. Just install. Do it!
"Simple and straightforward, friendly and competent service"
It is a very nice app and Bank... It really deserves to be rated five stars...
"Just tried new app. All installed and worked fine, but I wouldn't say it was a great improvement. It's a bit jumpy with the swipe function. Also prefer to see credits in different colour to debits (as per old app) also still can't view list of DD's and standing orders. Also would like to adjust overdraft facilities up and down without need to call. My advice is stick to an iPad and use website."
Easy to use and comes handy anywhere you are in the world.More than satisfied.
"App is ok, but a recent update broke a chart resolution feature. So now on the stock chart, it no longer remembers your chart interval and keeps resetting it to 5y whenever you change the stock you are looking at. Very annoying, pls fix it."
"Perfect, fast reply"
"helped me out with getting a small loan, and I like the investment part of it too. I'm on this app everyday. *update* was good....try to call them they never answer, when I email them they don't have any of my info on file and cant help me but I've been with them for over a year. Paid back instacash a month ago and it says I still owe. Terrible service."
